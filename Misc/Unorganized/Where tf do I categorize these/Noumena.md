# Noumena and Things-In-Self
See [[Kant]], [[Bergson]]
See [[Rationalism, Empiricism, & Idealism]]

## What are Noumena?
Noumena are the things that exist beyond our perception. For example, when I see a cup, I can only see the cup as it relates to me. I will only see the qualia that the cup has as I perceive it. I cannot perceive how the cup actually is (not in relation to anything else, but in-itself).
For example, the cup doesnt actually have the quality of "redness" or "solidity," but instead these are ideas we project on to it from the best of our capability. We can only see this cup as we see it, not as it is.



## Do noumena exist?

## Yes
See [[Locke]], [[Kant]], [[Bergson]], [[Hegel]]

"If I wish to explain to someone who does not know Greek the simple impression that a line of Home leaves upon me, I shall give the translation of the line,  then comment on my translation, then I shall develop my commentary, and from explanation to explanation I shall get closer to what I wish to express; but I shall never quite reach it." [[Discourse on Metaphysics]], 5
	[[Bergson]] extends this analogy to objects themself. Any description of an object will never be enough to make another person understand what it is without appealing to any other object.
	A painter substitutes the real image of Notre Dame in order to capture a schema of what it looked like to him. He takes the building out of context of the greater city, of the faults it may appear to have, and out of the time it existed in. The painting is a reconstruction of the reality of Notre Dame from one point of view. Metaphysicians do the same with Platonic concepts. [[Introduction to Metaphysics]], 28-29

### [[Bergson]]'s argument from Anthrodecentrism
We exist in a world among other objects and other things. To only put objects in our terms and say that is how objects truly are is unjustifiably anthropocentric.
	"To try a concept on an object is to ask what it can do for us... All knowledge properly so called is , therefore, turned into a certain direction  or taken from a certain point of view" [[Introduction to Metaphysics]], 38
