### Tofu Principles
https://cookieandkate.com/how-to-make-crispy-baked-tofu/
- toss tofu with soy, corstarch, and oil
- Dont marinade before cooking -- it makes the tofu wet, and it wont become crispy
- Salt the pan, not the tofu (?). Don't move it until you see a yellowish crust start to appear on the edges touching the pan
