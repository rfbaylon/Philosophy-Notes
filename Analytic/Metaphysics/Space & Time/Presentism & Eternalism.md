# Eternalism (B Theory)

B Theorists tend to believe that time is the 4th dimension. This is illustrated creatively in [[Vonnegut]]'s [[Slaughterhouse-Five]] by the alien creatures called 'Trafamadorians' which exist in all points in time 'simultaneously' by virtue of their 4th dimensional capabilities.

See [[Vonnegut]], [[Penrose]]

### Emperical Support
Currently in the field of theoretical physics, the B theory of time receives a lot of support given special relativity, the ADD model, and "brane cosmology." Special relativity gives good support in that in differently massed beings can have differing sets of events in the "present moment"
