# Concrescence
Concrescence is the name of for the process by which the universe of plurality of things can be subordinated into 'one' actual occasion.

## The Ontological Principle
AKA The Principle of efficient, and final, causation
This can also be considered a stronger [[Principle of Sufficient Reason]]

"The Ontological Principle is the first stage in constituting a theory of process" [[A Key to Whitehead's Process and Reality]], 19

Any act by any actual entity has reason to do so from *either* by an actual entity causing something or being being affected by another actual entity. 
	In other words, actual entities are the the only things that can be causes or effects. 
	'Causes' and 'reasons' are also synonymous
		"The ontological principle can be summarized as: no actual entity, then no reason" [[A Key to Whitehead's Process and Reality]] 18

## Actual Entities
AKA Actual Occasions

An actual entity is atomistic; Each is an actual organism that grows, matures, and perishes. These are the final real things by which the world is made up. **Actual entities' essences are that they consist solely in the fact they prehend.**
	Similar to [[Leibniz]]'s conception of monads (except that [[Whitehead]]'s monads change) or [[Deleuze]] & [[Guattari]]'s conception of machines.

Actual entities are formed from an act of consciousness arising from data
	these data are also called feelings, of which are a process. A vector from what is over there to what is felt here.
	"An actual entity arises from decisions *for* it, and by its very existence provides dcisions *for* other other actual entities which supercede it."

Also note that all actual entities are both subjects (receivers of data) and superjects (givers of data) at once.
	An actual entity feels the way that it feels such that it is the actual entity taht it is. This means that all actual entities are *causa sui* (final causes), which fills [[Spinoza]]'s definition of substance. This leads to a sort of substance infinitism, like [[Leibniz]]

### Prehension

**A prehension is a simple physical feeling caused by another actual entity**

Positive Prehension: The definite inclusion of an actual entity into a positive contribution to the subjects real constitution
	A prehension which is good for an object's constitution
Negative Prehension: The definite exclusion of an actual entity into a positive contribution to the subjects real constitution
	A prehension which is bad for an object's constitution

Prehension exists in 4 parts
	The superject (A)
	The subject (B)
	The datum being prehended (N)
	the subjective form of such datum (X)

Notes on this graph:
	The subjective form (X) meets data (N) in the Becoming which creates a vector.
	The cause (A) is objectively in the constitution of the effect (B).
		This solves a large problem in philosophy of causation, as it is impossible for something to come from nothing. This is a work around. 

#### Satisfaction

**Satisfaction is the completion and conclusion for an actual entity. It excludes all negative prehensions and includes all positive prehensions. This is also the termination of the becoming for this actual entity, as it thus attains objective immortality**
