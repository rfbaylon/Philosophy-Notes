[[My Stance]] on mathematical realism: Either Full Blooded Platonism is true or fictionalism is true. Anything else is metaphysically or epistemically contradictory.

# Platonic Positive Case


Today I stand before you on the affirmative to propose that mathematics was discovered, not invented.

First, Definitions:

“DISCOVER: Definition in the Cambridge English Dictionary.” DISCOVER | Definition in the Cambridge English Dictionary, dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/discover.

Discover: According to the Cambridge dictionary: “to [find](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/find) [information](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/information), a [place](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/place), or an [object](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/object), [especially](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/especially) for the first [time](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/time).” More specifically, ill be saying that we discover mathematical facts.

Platonism: The idea that mathematical objects exist independently of humans.

Math: Numbers and their relations

  

Values: Since this is a question of being, truth is the only thing we ought to value for this round.

## C1: Plenitudinous [[Plato]]nism


Picture a Nepalese village, and your friend comes up to you and tells you that the elder of this city is, right now, playing jump rope with his granddaughters. Your friend tells you this without ever visiting this village, so naturally it's impossible that he actually knows what the elder is up to, right? Well not really. If we assume there are infinite Nepalese villages where the elder is doing all consistent possible things, then your friend isn't wrong. It is thus an objectively true statement that the elder is playing jump rope, because it is within his physical capability. 

This is Mark [[Balaguer]]’s Theory of Plenitudinous Platonism, or Full Blooded Platonism (FBP) as he commonly refers to it as. This theory isn't 100% analogous, since the abstract realm is different from the physical realm, but in mathematics, this holds as an analogy. According to FBP, All mathematical objects that could possibly exist in a consistent theory actually do exist. 

This idea does wonders for the math world and is actually subliminally used all of the time in physics and geometry, where two branches of mathematics, noneuclidean geometry and euclidean geometry, are used in conjunction despite being mutually exclusive. It not only solves the epistemological problem, and the nonuniqueness problem, but it gives mathematicians freedom to explore the mathematical realm while having absolutely none of the downsides that nominalism has (which I will get into). 

To put it succinctly I will most likely agree with my opponents about a lot of the attacks on regular platonism, which is why my opponents have to attack specifically FBP, not traditional platonism. 

  
  
  
## C2: The [[Quine]]an Argument 


This is a purely rational proof, so in order to actually win this round, my opponent has to tell me exactly which premise they disagree with. If they don't attack it, they concede this point.

  
The argument is simple

(P1) The only way to account for the truth of our mathematical theories is to adopt platonism.

(P2) Empirical sciences, such as physics, rely on Mathematics to exist

(P3) Empirical science makes true statements about the world

(C) Platonism is true and Anti-Platonism is false

  
To break it down, we need math to exist in order to make the most sense of our world. Math is a necessary indispensable component for physicists, chemists, biologists, and quantum mechanists, and they need the truth value of math in order for their field of study to be true, let alone exist. If we accept physics is true, we have to accept the building blocks of physics as true. 

The only way that math makes true statements about the world is if you side with the AFF. The NEG holds that mathematics is a social construct, and so they can't access any truth statements from their theory.

Another way to look at Quine’s theory is to ask “What is true?”. Quine’s answer is that which provides the most complete picture of the world around us. That which we need to understand our world. And since mathematics definitely provides us with significantly more understanding of our world, as it is the building block of so many sciences, it has to be true.

  

For example, Sir Isaac Newton developed his theory of gravitational pull, after we developed the empirical means to test his hypothesis hundreds of years later, he was correct down to the millionth of a decimal point. A test in 2008 found that Newton's Inverse Square law holds up to a distance of 56 microns (56 millionths of a meter), exactly what he predicted. If math is false, how could it ever be relevant to physics or the physical world? 

  

## C3: Neo-Logicism

  
Logicism is the idea that math is entirely reducible to logic, as proven by Gottleib [[Frege]] in the late 19th century. In his 300 page treatise on just proving this, he develops a theory of consistency and correspondence. Numbers to Frege are nothing but compact ways of expressing logical expressions. In essence, he developed a system by which “2” people at the table become person x and person y are at the table, in which x is not y, and in which there exists nothing else at the table. Although Frege’s definition of “2” is mouth-full, it still shows that mathematical truths are just as true as logical ones. Just as all men have beards, Socrates is a man, Socrates has a beard is true, and purports to be about actual things, 2 + 3 = 5 is a logically true statement about numbers, which are real objects. Neo-Logicism, the project I will defend today, is merely a continuation of Frege and Russel’s work to fill in some of the holes they left behind.

  

Put more bluntly, Frege describes the number 0, for example, using purely logical terms. x ¬x = x, or Number X paired with the negation of X, while being equal to X is 0.

  

As [[Russell]] summarizes, “The fact that all Mathematics is Symbolic Logic is one of the greatest discoveries of our age; and when this fact has been established, the remainder of the principles of mathematics consists in the analysis of Symbolic Logic itself”

  

Like [Gottlob Frege](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/frege/), [[Russell]]’s basic idea for defending logicism was that numbers may be identified with classes of classes and that number-theoretic statements may be explained in terms of quantifiers and identity. Thus the number 1 is to be identified with the class of all unit classes, the number 2 with the class of all two-membered classes, and so on. Statements such as “There are at least two books” would be recast as statements such as “There is a book, x, and there is a book, y, and x is not identical to y.” Statements such as “There are exactly two books” would be recast as “There is a book, x, and there is a book, y, and x is not identical to y, and if there is a book, z, then z is identical to either x or y.” It follows that number-theoretic operations may then be explained in terms of set-theoretic operations such as intersection, union, and difference. 

  

Following the logic chain presented, 

P1 Math is reducible to logic as proved by Frege

P2 Logic is true independent of humanity

C1 Mathematics has to be true, which can only result in an Affirmative Ballot

  

Thus in this round today, the Affirmation has proven multiple ways in which they dodge traditional attacks to platonists, accounted for the truth value of physics and science, and proven that you are literally logical to vote for the AFF.

## Anti-Platonism =/= Invention

1.  Anti-Platonism doesn't necessarily mean that mathematics was invented. Even if mathematical objects don't exist, we still discover objective facts about math. Given Anti-Platonism, there is s
    

## [[Benacerraf]]'s Problem of Epistemology

“If we can't touch, taste, hear, smell, or see numbers, how to we get any knowledge of them”

1.  My argument, followed from Mark Balaguer, has 2 premises: 

1.  P1 Math exists
    
2.  P2 We can know if axioms are consistent.
    

The first premise is trivially true, since in order to talk about math being invented or discovered, math has to exist in the first place. And for the second premise, since Bertrand Russell proved that mathematics can be reduced to logic, is also definitionally true. If given a game of monopoly, I can act consistently within the given rules without access to some divine world of monopoly rules. Consistency is easy to measure in monopoly, just as it is with math.

2.  My worldview is one of Full Blooded Platonism, in which all consistent mathematical theories are true. Although Benacerraf’s argument is true against a typical platonist, this issue does not apply to me. Going back to the analogy of the Nepalise village that I mentioned in my constructive, my friend doesnt have to directly experience the village in order to make true statements about it. It is a TRUE statement that the elder is playing jump rope with his daughters as long as we assume all possible things the elder could be doing is true. It is consistent within the framework of axioms of “what the elder has the physical capacity to do” As long as infinite nepalise villages exist, any consistent statement about the elder is true even if my friend didn't have any physical connection to it. Likewise, we don't have to have knowledge about the mathematical realm to make meaningful and true statements about it, as long as they are consistent. 
    
3.  Importantly aswell, very few philosophers take Benaceraff’s assumptions seriously, as it is a rash over generalization. The idea that we need to have sensory experience of something in order to have knowledge about it isnt even a universal truth within the philosophical community, and mathematics provides a wonderful counterexample. The view was based off of Alvin Goldman’s causal theory of knowledge which epistemologists, according to philosopher Oystien Linnebo, have largely abandoned. 
    
4.  There are plenty of things in the world that we can't feel, see, hear, taste, or smell that we also have no sensual perception of, such as possibilities. Abstract objects ([[Plato]]) such as a possibility have no physical qualities, but it would be absurd to say they don't exist. Ditto with numbers.
    
5.  We necessitate the process of abstraction to even begin to ponder the question surrounding abstract objects. This abstraction itself proves that the “abstract world” clearly does exist in some regard because we need it in order to “abstract” in the first place.

  
## [[Benacerraf]]’s Problem of Identification

“How do we know which mathematical theory is correct?”

1.  All consistent theories are correct, as I have stated. Us FBPists embrace this mathematical multiplicity with open arms. When bringing up the Zermelo vs Von Neumann problem, and others related to it, as long as the theorems are internally consistent, they're true. We can easily determine which ones are true through consistent mathematical axioms, so we don't need this talk of “one or the other.” Although this would be a very big and unsolvable problem for the average platonist, us FBPists embrace nonuniqueness. Put more bluntly, we don't have to decide between euclidean and non-euclidean geometry, because they are both consistent, and thus true.
    

## [[Ockham’s Razor]]

“Ockham’s Razor demands we get rid of excess ontological baggage, and numbers are hella baggy”

1.  By making the argument from Ockham’s Razor, the NEG says they have the same amount of explanatory power as I do, but that's just wrong. First off, fictionalism does nothing to account for everything that FBP accounts for, such as the truth of mathematics. Unlike fictionalism, FBP allows us to actually say our scientific theories are true, meaning we have way more explanatory power than the NEG. For example, because math is true, physics as a science makes true statements, and physics needs to be true to have our best understanding of our world.
    

 FBP actually allows us to say sentences like 2+2=4 are true, and completely avoid Quine’s Indispensability argument. The point of Ockham's Razor is to reduce the number of loops and cogs, but FBP doesn't add these loops, cogs, and unnecessary complexity that my opponent claims they do. It doesn't complicate our understanding of the world at all, and in fact it simplifies it, and provides the clearest way towards truth.

2.  You are misusing Ockhams razor
    

  
Classical Mechanics

“Classical Mechanics and other mathematical theorems are used, despite their falsity”

1.  Brandon Fielton, a philosopher of mathematics at Northeastern University, who I interviewed for this debate, makes the clear distinction between utility and truth value, or as he put it, “explanation vs. prediction.” These theories, such as classical mechanics, are insanely useful for predicting the world and making general guesses as to how an object will interact with the world around it. This says nothing about it's explanatory value. These mathematical statements that are false don't explain the world in any way. So if my goal is to describe the world, I will use true mathematics. If my goal is to make a generally working car, then I will use classical mechanics. The latter doesn't matter right now, because the debate is centered around how the world is.
    

  

Game Formalism

“Mathematics is invented like the rules of chess are invented”

1.  With chess, you invent the rules and then you play the game. With mathematics however, we discover the rules after. Peano formalized the rules of basic arithmetic in 1889, despite the global population using arithmetic well before that. It seems like mathematics is completely different, it seems natural and omnipresent. If it were like chess, then how could we possibly practice it before we knew the rules???
    
2.  Another objection, formalized by Gottlieb Frege, was that we learn mathematics in school, but not chess or Apples to Apples. This is because mathematics has a very real application in the real world. Its used by literally everyone every day. To say it is as arbitrary as the rules of chess, while also acknowledging its omnipresence is completely absurd. Clearly its implications in the world stem from so much more than something equivalent to a Monopoly rulebook.
    
3.  A second objection via Frege is that it opens itself up to complete subjectivity. With the rules of mathematics, the statement “1=0” is just as viable and true as “1=1.” In order to avoid this, my opponent has to commit to the idea that there is something natural, independent, and objective within mathematics, which means they would have to agree with me. 
    

  

[[Kant]]

“Mathematics is a mental construction, an a posteriori truth”

1.  [[Kant]] is an epistemological constructivist. Basically, what this means is that he believes every truth is invented, including math. If you believe that mathematics is constructed by the brain as a matter of fact, then you also have to provide a reason why we draw the line at math. Under Kant’s world, the statement “The earth exists'' is an invented truth, and wouldn't be true if humans don't exist. Basically the debate breaks down to this: If you believe that the earth would exist even if humans weren't here, vote AFF. If you buy that ALL truth is constructed (which is a very unappealing position), then you have to be able to say, like my opponent, that the statement “The earth exists” would be an untrue statement.
    
2.  The problem of identification still holds for Kant. How can [[Kant]] meaningfully distinguish between the truth value of Euclidean and Non-Euclidean geometries, despite both of them seeming to have the same exact apriori standing? How can the truths of Euclidean geometry be underwritten by the alternative but equally backed-up truths of Non-Euclidean geometry?
    

## Everything is Mentally Constructed

“Human perception creates reality, nothing exists outside of human subjectivity”

“Everything is relative, bro”

1.  A quick appeal to common sense would tell us that the big bang happened, even though nobody was there to perceive it. Atoms would still exist even if subjectivity didn't exist. Logical statements such as “all cats are black, sam is a cat, sam is black” would still be true. A phenomenological critique, which is what my opponent is attempting to do would consist of saying that nothing meaningfully exists outside of human perception, and that humans give everything meaning. Under this definition, platonic math still exists, and a large number of phenomenologists are mathematical platonists, such as myself.
    
2.  To illustrate this point, mathematical philosopher, Oystien Linnebo, asks us to consider a reculusive mathematical genius who discovers a mathematical theorem, but dies before she can share it. Using our opponents framework, we would then be tied to the assumption that as soon as this person dies, the theorom would not be true anymore. This is clearly absurd, as mathematical truths are truths that hold independantly of what humans believe. This theorom would still hold true, even if this genius died.
    

  

God invented everything

“God invented everything, and that includes mathematics”

1.  My opponent has to prove, beyond a doubt, that God exists and was the first mover. This is impossible if they choose to run this contention. 
    
2.  This is abusive and hinders debate. This is clearly outside of the framers intent with this debate, and it would be impossible for me to not only learn anything from this debate, but also to participate in a fair manner. Thus based on this alone, vote AFF
    
3.  Also, when we frame something in the context of invention or discovery, we have to have an actor. For example, we can say that acorns are invented by trees, but discovered by humans. We can say that a boat was invented by vikings but discovered by archeologists. It all depends on the actor we are talking about. Of course, when we look towards the framing of the resolution, we can very easily take the implication that it means “math was discovered, not invented by humans,” as BQ resolutions are always anthropocentric.  This provides fairness towards both sides, and allows for a much more educational debate.
    

## Mathematical Paradoxes

“Mathematical paradoxes exist which create inconsistencies within it's own axioms”

1.  Historically, paradoxes get solved. For example, take Zeno’s paradox, which was solved by [[Leibniz]] and Newton. The Triangle Perimeter paradox (along with MANY others) were solved by Burtrand [[Russell]]. [[Russell]]'s paradox has been solved by Russell in his later years. Looking at this dialectically, progress within the discovery of mathematics does happen as humanity gets smarter and more connected. According to philosopher Luc de Brabandère, “Math progresses when we embrace these paradoxes”
    

  

Math is true, even if invented!!!!

“GIMME ACCESS TO TRUTH”

1.  This cannot be the case. The NEG has to claim that mathematics was invented, and if this is the case, math is thus a social construct. Social constructs have no objective truths to them because, by definition, they are subjective. You can't invent truth
    
2.  If you believe that abstract objects such as numbers do exist independently, then you agree with me, and you have to buy my point. If you don't believe abstract numbers exist or that numbers are not abstract objects, then they have to be mental objects. Examples of mental objects include unicorns, harry potter, and ideas. The thing about mental objects though, is you can't make any truth statement about them. You can't say “unicorns have one horn” is a true statement, because unicorns don't exist. You're not talking about anything true or independent. Thus by the same logic, you can't claim that 2+2=4 because you don't believe 2 or 4 exist outside of the brain.
    

## The Problem of 0 (A)

“0 Is a new phenomena, as ancients never used it, but still did math”

1.  At first we had not discovered 0 yet. Someone came along and discovered 0, and now we use it. We make discoveries like this all the time. 0 as a property still existed, even if they didn't know about it. This may be the case right now in Quantum Mechanics where there's a fundamental property we haven't discovered, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. We still do objective math though. This point does not really prove anything excep[t for the fact that we tend to discover new stuff as time goes on.
    

## The Problem of 0 (B)

“If 0 exists, and 0 is nothingness, you're trapped in a paradox of nothingness existing”

1.  “0” doesn't represent anything at all, it is a thing in itself. Although it's numerical and logical value is 0, that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. It simply just is a thing, an object. We can look towards a vacuum for instance, where a vacuum still exists, it just has an air pressure value of zero. Both of these things exist, it's just their value in the mathematical realm is null. In a word, 0 is a thing with a numerical value of zero, but it's still a thing.
    

Imaginary Numbers

“Imaginary numbers exist and are useful, but don't exist in your world! What are they!!!!!???”

1.  First off, it doesnt really matter since you cant answer this in any way either. If this is a critical problem for me, its a critical problem for my opponent too. If what they say is true, then they also have to answer the same problem they posed to me, which is “how is it possible for imaginary numbers to exist, while being wholly irrational?”
    
2.  To further answer the question, there is no reason to believe that imaginary numbers dont exist. As I have already structured with my first and second contention, these imaginary and complex numbers have just as much “being” as natural numbers. Because of FBP, we can assume they exist since they are logically possible, and because of Quines empirical holism, we can assume they exist because they are indispensable to fields, such as electrical engineering and mechanics as a whole.
    

CounterBlocks

========================================================================

  

# Full Blooded [[Plato]]nism

## Contradiction

“Theory XYZ and XY~Z cannot both exist at the same time, since they contradict each other”

1.  Full Blooded Platonists embrace this. They both do exist, but they just both describe different parts of the mathematical world. They describe different kinds of sets, and different universes of sets. Different sets that exist side by side, as long as they are consistent, exist. As long as XYZ and XY~Z don't exist within the same theory, it is true.
    

  

## Consistency isn't enough to prove truth

“Mathematicians don't use consistency to determine whether something is true, so why should FBP?”

1.  Consistency is enough to prove truth. What we call what is true that is consistent with our best theories of the world. Laws of physics are consistent with how the world works, so thus we call them true. If it wasn't for consistency, we couldnt make any truth statements.
    

  
  

[[Godel]]’s Second Theorem

“A mathematical system cannot prove its own consistency”

1.  According to philosopher Haskell Curry, we can prove consistency within a mathematical system by assuming the consistency of another theory that we know to be consistent. Thus, Godel’s problem is completely avoided.
    

## FBP sacrifices the objectivity of math

“This denies Hillbertian Optimism, and says that there are some questions with no objective answers”

1.  My opponent already suggests there is no objectivity to their side. This isn't unique to my side, and thus this point cannot be a voting issue.
    
2.  FBP IS actually objective. When we make statements about numbers, we are referring to actual objects. The statement “Under ZFC, 2+2=4” is an objectively true statement that can be logically proven according to Frege and Russell. 2 and 4 are actual objects, and “equals” is an actual comparison. Sam and Aly are the same height is just as true of a statement as 2+2=4
    
3.  This argument actually works for FBP. Traditional platonists struggle with the idea that it would be impossible to find an objective to some open questions (such as the Zermelo- Von Neumann Problem in set theory). This is good for 2 reasons
    

1.  The philosophy of math is supposed to interpret math, not put metaphysical restrictions on what mathematicians can and cannot study. Open questions are essential to math.
    
2.  It seems intuitively pleasing to say that some questions have objectively correct answers, while others do not. If multiple people come up with correct and consistent answers, I really don't see a problem with this.
    

  

## New Epistemic problem from “standard models”

“How could human beings pick out a unique model to call ‘standard’?”

1.  We don't need to answer this, because we already have one. This doesn't raise a challenge at all to my belief. We didn't divine this knowledge through “the spectre of mathematics itself,” we simply used our intuitions, and found what happened to be a consistent theory. Since Peano Arithmetic (what we consider standard) is consistent and what we all use, we post hoc called it standard.
    
2.  We currently use multiple models in the status quo. We use BOTH euclidean and non euclidean geometry, and we use BOTH zermelo fraenkel and Von Neumann set theory. A standard model isn't explicitly necessary.
    

## Limits universal set statements

“FBP forbids us to speak of the entirety of sets”

1.  This isn't true. If someone developed an intuitively plausible theory, settled all important questions of set theory, and picked out a unique universe of sets that corresponded to our notion of set, then this theory is a theory of all sets. 
    
2.  Not only that, but the statement “all sets contain members” is a universal set statement, and this one statement alone refutes the point
    
3.  We don't actually need this. Universal statements can simply be qualified. “Under ZFC, all sets have property X” “Under VN set theory, all sets have property Y.” This isn't actually a massive issue, itll just have to make it so mathematicians are slightly more careful with their terminology
    
4.  This isn't even a problem. This does not disprove anything. Even if I conceded it, this wouldn't take down FBP in any way.
    

  

## Limiting universal mathematical statements

“FBP forbids us to peak of the entirety of the mathematical realm”

1.  This is just false. Take for example the statement “all mathematical objects are abstract objects.” Boom. Disproven. 
    
2.  This isn't even a problem. This does not disprove anything. Even if I conceded it, this wouldn't take down FBP in any way.
    

  

## Complete relativism bad

“If someone says that 1+2=4, and their theory is consistent, they are technically correct”

1.  Although this statement does describe part of the mathematical realm, it obviously doesn't apply to the whole of mathematics. There is no problem here. The difference is in the preface. The radical proposing that 1+2 = 4 would have to say “Under my axioms which i call Radicalism, 1+2=4,” and they would be saying something true. The average mathematician could simply just reply “cool, i don't care. I focus on Peano arithmetic, so your statement is meaningless to me”
    
2.  It's gonna be SUPER hard to create a consistent theory in which 2+2=5, if not impossible. In order for this to work, they would have to use one of the terms in a nonstandard way, such as their 4 is equal to our 3.
    

  

## Belief =/= Mathematical truth

“How do we know that our belief of math correlates with math itself?”

1.  This is essentially Benacerraf’s epistemological problem, to which I will refer myself there. [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W8-SmlRs533yniBa7J1ao_N3kgaLHL1iXrTaBXArLzI/edit#bookmark=id.p7avhuhrt9rc)
    

  

## Definitions of mathematical objects blur

“If 3 can be both prime in one mathematical theory, and composite in another, then what even is 3?”

1.  FBP embraces this multiplicity, but with every mention of 3, there would have to be a hidden implied prefix that is “according to Peano Arithmetic” or “according to a theory with axioms x, y and z.” If we add this prefix to any mathematical statement, then it becomes precise. 
    

# [[Quine]]-Putnam Problem

    

## Field’s Strategy of Nominalization

1.  Most importantly, according to philosopher of math Brandon Fieltson, who I interviewed for this debate, Field proves the uselessness of mathematics purely on his “representation theorems” which in fact ARE abstract objects. Thus, Field uses abstract mathematical concepts to disprove abstraction in mathematics, in essence, just shifting the problem elsewhere. His project does nothing to negate the idea of abstract objects in mathematics because he uses abstract objects to do it. Therefore, you can't buy Field.
    
2.   According to Malament, Field cannot nominalize Quantum Mechanics, so under Field’s worldview, quantum mechanics does not exist. Malaments Objection goes as follows: “I do not see how filled can get started nominalizing QM at all. I suppose one can think of the theory as determining a set of models -  each a Hilbert space. but what form would the recovery theorem take? The only theory that comes to mind is a theorem of the sort sought by Jauch, Piron, et al. They start with “propositions” and lattice theoretic relations as primitive, and then seek to prove that the lattice of propositions is necessarily isomorphic to the lattice of subspaces of some hilbert space. But of course no theorem of the sort would be of any use to Field. What could be worse than propositions?” In quantum mechanics, one of the most basic levels of measurement is with Hilbert Spaces, a term coined by David Hilbert in the 80s. Hilbert spaces don't represent actual physical objects, so saying that numbers are only used to represent physical objects is clearly false. Because of this, my opponent can only actually say that math is useful for algebra and basic arithmetic, because those, in theory, could represent physical things. They have to admit since hilbert spaces aren't physical things, that math as my opponent is proposing clearly can't be useful. In short, quantum mechanics deals with probabilities and propositions, each of which are abstract objects. Since you can't nominalize an already abstract practice, my opponent must be committed to saying that quantum mechanics is a useless mathematical practice, since apparently abstract objects don't exist.
    
3.  Field never gave a method to nominalize anything, he just took Newton’s gravitational theorem, nominalized it, and then didn't tell his readers how to nominalize any other scientific, indispensable theory. How can you nominalize another theory, specifically since his process of nominalization is unique to gravitation?
    

  

# Logicism

  
  

[[Russell]]'s Paradox

“Russel already proved in 1903 that Frege’s Logicism was inconsistent”

1.  Although this isn't wrong, Russels addition of an axiom of classification to Frege’s theorem completely solved this. Although Russell disagreed with Frege, his later work built upon it to make Logicism more tenable. Russell was a Logicist himself, afterall. [[Russell]]'s brand, paired with the ZFC axioms is the position I hold of Logicism.
    

  

Logicism is invented

“You didn't solve the problem, if I claim that [[Logic]] is invented, you end up at square 1”

1.  This cannot be the case. We cannot invent logical truths. For example, “all cats are black, Sam is a cat, Sam is black” would still be definitionionally true, even if humans didn't exist. This is what philosopher Immanuel Kant calls a priori knowledge, and it cannot be reliant on human perspective because it is definitionally true.
    

  
  

[[Godel]]’s Incompleteness Theorem

“It's impossible to construct a complete and consistent formal language to derive all of math with”

1.  The most important argument on this subject is that Godel’s theorem only proved this was the case for a small sect of math. This proof only applied to basic arithmetic, leaving many other sections of mathematics logistically kosher. These sects are called “decidable mathematics” and include branches such as Boolean algebra, Probability theory and calculus, and basic theory of real numbers. Even if you agree with my opponents that Godel’s theorem “destroyed” the arithmatic project of Logicism, other forms of Logicism still hold true.
    
2.  Godel’s incompleteness bares no offensive power against Neo-Logicism. For a little history lesson, Frege relied on something he dubbed Basic Principle V when he devised his first draft of logicism based on Hume’s principle. Neo-Logicists such as Hale and Wright correctly argue that logicism can make do with Hume’s principle alone. Fortunately for the Logicist project, this transformative step of deriving all mathematical reasoning from Humes Principle alone avoids the problems posed by Godel’s Incompleteness theorem. 
    
3.  Godel was a platonist, and thus would agree with me on this point. He was a platonist his entire life, so clearly his theorem posed no problem with this idea that math was in fact discovered.
    

  

Julius Caesar Problem

“Numbers fit just as well into arithmetic statements as people”

  

1.  Frege responded to this problem by designating numbers as types rather than distinct objects. He gave the example of directions. Instead of accepting directions as a distinct kind of object, we may identify the direction a line l1  with an equivalence class of all lines that are parallel to l1. Thus, because of Frege’s recarving of classes, we now can now easily separate numbers from people and other objects.
    

  
FBP and Logicism are incompatible

“Full blooded platonism says numbers all consistent theories are true, yet not all consistent logical theorems are true”

1.  The creator of FBP, Mark Balaguer, already heeded this concern and insists on page 74 of his book “Platonism and Anti Platonism in mathematics” that they are in fact compatible. I also directly interviewed and asked him if there was any contradiction, and Mark Balaguer replied that there was no contradiction between Logicism and FBP. There is no contradiction here. The reason for this is because “the logical truth that theory T is consistent can give rise to knowledge of mathematical fact that T accurately describes some part of the mathematical realm.” The full definition of “FBP” is “Any number that could logically exist does exist, thus incorporating the heart of Logicism into his own project.

# Random Notes
  

Prefer FBP because it can account for the existence of open questions with open OR closed answers, it maintains the objectivity of math, and gives mathematicians freedom within their study.

  

If Maths was invented, Godel wouldn't have been able to prove its limits,by sheer invention,we would have overcome this limit,but it is objective Maths that limits us (???)

It could easily be argued that all inventions are discovered.

Imagine a planet in which everything is possible. Let's call this planet “Zoton.” On Zoton, there are talking donkeys, flying baboons, and 3 headed people. No matter what I say about Zoton, assuming it is consistent, it will be true. For example, I could read the sentence “there are 3 eyed alligators on Zoton” and learn something about the actual world. Now of course this view is preposterous when looking at physical matter,  

Uniform Semantics

[[Benacerraf]]

1.  There are at least 3 cities older than new york
    
2.  There are at least 3 numbers greater than 17
    
3.  There are at least 3 G’s that bear R to a
    

The object a has relation R to G. Now what the neg has to do is say that neither is true, or say that there's something fundamentally different in the syntax


### CX: Problem of Infinity

Euclid's proof says that there are infinitely many prime numbers. Since infinity of any physical or mental object cant exist, the only other type of object to exist would have to be abstract objects

  

P1 There are infinitely many prime numbers (As proved by Euclid)

P2 Infinite physical objects cannot exist

P3 Infinite mental objects cannot exist (only a certain amount of thoughts can be thought with a finite amount of brains)

C1 There must be some other possibly infinite object for P1 to purport to be about reality

P4 We will call these non-spatio-temporal objects “abstract objects”

C2 Abstract objects exist

C3 Abstract objects exist independently of anything physical (They are causally and effectually inert)

P5 Humans are purely physical beings

C4 Humans cannot have invented abstract objects, such as numbers
