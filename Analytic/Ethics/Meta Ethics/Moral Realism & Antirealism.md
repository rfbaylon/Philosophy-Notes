### 3 Approaches to Solving the Grounding Problem

#### [[Deontology]]

#### [[Utilitarianism]]

#### [[Virtue Ethics]]

### The Ontological Argument
P1: Ethics may be real
P2: If there is a 50% chance your next action will have no moral value and a 50% chance it will have a terrible moral value then you should not commit that action
P3: Based on (2) and (1) if ethics may be real then you should act as if it’s real.
Conclusion: If you accept premise 3 then ethics must be real, as saying you “should act” as if ethics is real is in and of itself a moral statement and thus as long as you believe (1) and (2) ethics must be real.

### Indefinability

The "Good" is indefinable, but this is not an issue for Realists. All things that are real have incredibly fuzzy boundaries around them and fully understanding anything n such an inexhaustible reality is impossible. Though its precise nature cannot be pinned though doesnt mean it does not exist. Instead we have directions that point to moral perfection, commonly known as virtues.

# Antirealism

## Antirealism
See [[Hume]], [[Nietzsche]], [[Spinoza]], [[Hobbes]], [[Sartre]], [[Mackie]]

### [[Hume]]'s Is / Ought Problem
Humans believe their pleasure to be good and pain to be bad, but according to Philosopher David Hume, that doesn't mean we are morally obligated to feel pleasure or avoid suffering. Just because it is the case, doesn't mean it ought to be. ‘Is’ and ‘Ought’ are in two completely different realms of description, one describing the natural world, and the other describing the moral landscape, so no descriptive or ‘is’ premises can possibly describe what should happen
	A2: [[Kant]]


### CosmicSkeptic's Argument

Let's say that you live in a town that all citizens happen to believe that yellow is the best color, when deciding what color to paint the town statue, the town ought to decide to paint it yellow, because they all believe yellow is the best color. Does this mean that yellow is objectively the best color? No. How much a person likes a color is subjective, based on feeling, and cannot possibly be grounded in pure reason. If a person thinks they should paint it blue, while it is also true that they believe that yellow is the best color, that person would be wrong. Again, not because yellow is the objectively best color, but because if we run under the assumption that they believe yellow is the best color (which they have to, by definition) then we can objectively explain to them why yellow would be a better color to paint the statue.

Now let's take this into morality. Lets replace Yellow with pleasure. All humans naturally feel like pleasure is good for them, subjectively. Pleasure is a subjective experience, which cannot exist a priori or in other words without the human experience. So. We all naturally, yet subjectively feel as if pleasure is good and that we ought to live in a ‘yellow’ society that acknowledges our natural experiences. If someone wants to do a blue action, in this case stab someone to feel pleasure, we can objectively explain to them that a society in which people murder eachother for fun would be at odds with their natural inclination towards personal pleasure. 

I.e., just because everyone agrees that something is bad, doesnt actually make it bad metaphysically.
	A2: We can still do morality within this schema, it will just be psudo-objective

### [[Sartre]]'s Argument
See [[Rorty]]
There are examples of moral dilemmas that exist that have no obvious moral answer, or even a moral answer. Kant, God, Mill, or any one else can really tell this student what the "right thing" to do is, as there are immeasurable tradeoffs.
	"As an example by which you may the better understand this state of abandonment, I will refer to the case of a pupil of mine, who sought me out in the following circumstances. His father was quarrelling with his mother and was also inclined to be a “collaborator”; his elder brother had been killed in the German offensive of 1940 and this young man, with a sentiment somewhat primitive but generous, burned to avenge him. His mother was living alone with him, deeply afflicted by the semi-treason of his father and by the death of her eldest son, and her one consolation was in this young man. But he, at this moment, had the choice between going to England to join the Free French Forces or of staying near his mother and helping her to live. He fully realised that this woman lived only for him and that his disappearance – or perhaps his death – would plunge her into despair. He also realised that, concretely and in fact, every action he performed on his mother’s behalf would be sure of effect in the sense of aiding her to live, whereas anything he did in order to go and fight would be an ambiguous action which might vanish like water into sand and serve no purpose. For instance, to set out for England he would have to wait indefinitely in a Spanish camp on the way through Spain; or, on arriving in England or in Algiers he might be put into an office to fill up forms. Consequently, he found himself confronted by two very different modes of action; the one concrete, immediate, but directed towards only one individual; and the other an action addressed to an end infinitely greater, a national collectivity, but for that very reason ambiguous – and it might be frustrated on the way. At the same time, he was hesitating between two kinds of morality; on the one side the morality of sympathy, of personal devotion and, on the other side, a morality of wider scope but of more debatable validity. He had to choose between those two. What could help him to choose? Could the Christian doctrine? No. Christian doctrine says: Act with charity, love your neighbour, deny yourself for others, choose the way which is hardest, and so forth. But which is the harder road? To whom does one owe the more brotherly love, the patriot or the mother? Which is the more useful aim, the general one of fighting in and for the whole community, or the precise aim of helping one particular person to live? Who can give an answer to that _a priori_? No one. Nor is it given in any ethical scripture. The Kantian ethic says, Never regard another as a means, but always as an end. Very well; if I remain with my mother, I shall be regarding her as the end and not as a means: but by the same token I am in danger of treating as means those who are fighting on my behalf; and the converse is also true, that if I go to the aid of the combatants I shall be treating them as the end at the risk of treating my mother as a means. If values are uncertain, if they are still too abstract to determine the particular, concrete case under consideration, nothing remains but to trust in our instincts. That is what this young man tried to do; and when I saw him he said, “In the end, it is feeling that counts; the direction in which it is really pushing me is the one I ought to choose. If I feel that I love my mother enough to sacrifice everything else for her – my will to be avenged, all my longings for action and adventure then I stay with her. If, on the contrary, I feel that my love for her is not enough, I go.” But how does one estimate the strength of a feeling? The value of his feeling for his mother was determined precisely by the fact that he was standing by her. I may say that I love a certain friend enough to sacrifice such or such a sum of money for him, but I cannot prove that unless I have done it. I may say, “I love my mother enough to remain with her,” if actually I have remained with her. I can only estimate the strength of this affection if I have performed an action by which it is defined and ratified. But if I then appeal to this affection to justify my action, I find myself drawn into a vicious circle." [[Existentialism is a Humanism]], 30

### The Combinatory Problem
How exactly do we weigh competing interests against eachother? it seems to be a purely intuitive method that cannot create any objective answers.
	A2: [[J.S. Mill]]: One has to treat competing claims as if they came from one distinct person. All of the claims in the world must be from the perspective of an amalgamated individual with all of the interests of everyone always.
		A2A2: [[Nagel]]: This is not only unimaginable (and thus unhelpful), but it entirely ignores the separateness of persons.
	A2: [[Rawls]] All parties ought to act as though they were behind a [[veil of ignorance]], and act in their own best interest given that they do not know which position they could occupy after teh veil has been lifted
		A2A2: [[Nagel]]: This denies that peoples lives as they are are not potentialities, but genuine actalities. This also reduces into a form of subjectivism; What happens when people disagree when behind the veil?
	A2: [[Nagel]]: "The choice of an interpersonal weighting principle be made under the condition that the chooser expects to lead *all* of the lives in question, not as a single super-life ([[J.S. Mill]]), but as a set of distinct individual lives, each of them a complete set of experiences and activity" [[The Possibility of Altruism]], 141
