# Social Contract Theory

Built on [[Moral Egoism]]
Is a form of [[Moral Realism & Antirealism]] or pseudorealism, depending on the flavor

## Social Contract Theory
See [[Hobbes]], [[Destiny]], [[Stirner]]

### Argument From Evolutionary Psych
Humans first developed morality from when we had monkey brains.
	A2: [[Singer]]: This is a descriptive case of history. This may have been how morality originally developed in the first place, but this doesnt necessarily mean that after we started thinking about morality, we have come to more conclusions about altruism. This argument itself isnt enough to prove social contract thoery.
		"Just as the first mathematicians, who may have started counting in order to keep track ofthe number of people in their tribe, had no idea that they were taking the firrst steps along a path that would lead to the infinitesimal calculas, so the origins of ethics tell us nothing about where ethics should end" [[Practical Ethics]], 62-63 #Quote 

## A2 Social Contract Theory

### [[Singer]]'s Argument From Marginal Cases
Under contract theory, only rational agents eligible to understand and respect a contract ought to be morally considered. 
	This excludes:
	- Babies
	- (permenantly) Mentally Disabled People
	- Nonhuman Animals
	- Future Humans (precluding us from worrying about climate change)
	- [[Destiny]] Humans who dont speak your language and you cant learn theirs (Clip of Destiny saying its OK to bomb north sentinel island as the inhabitants would never reciprocate value with him) #Cite 
		A2A2: [[Kagan]]: But babies and future humans have the *capacity* to enter reciprocal agreements. Mentally disabled people are *modally* valuable i.e., it is conceivable they *could* reciprocate vakues in a different world.
			A2A2A2: But at this point have you not entirely abandoned reciprocity all together? Why adopt a contractarian view at all if you believe this? [[Practical Ethics]], 64
