### Unity of the Virtues

According to [[Murdoch]], there is a strong unity between the virtues. Pure and unfettered contemplation of the just is better realized by agents that understand courage, beneficence, humility, temperance, etc. This is because clearer vision of the world as it is allows for less fantasy in vision generally.
	[[Sovereignty of Good]], loc 1022

You will also be hard pressed to find someone who is the correct amount of honest, but is otherwise an incredibly viscious person. 
## Moral Epistemic Dystopia
Imagine this:
After the a dystopia takes over the world, mere scraps of scientific knowledge are left behind. From there, rebel scientists develop what they take to be the truth of science based on the mere scraps of what we have today unknowingly creating simulacrums of what science ought to be. 
We are in the same position as it relates to moral theory. Overly rationalist and enlightnement thinkers dont do justice to the well developed ethical theory of ancient Greece, but are mere simulacrums of good moral theory. 

Over the past 200 years, moral philosophy has focused on 3 main characteristics of argumentation
1. Logical validity fo arguments with sneaky normative premesies
2. The presented arguments are all impersonal and universal
3. All ethical thinking will trace through history



## Virtue Ethics
See [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[MacIntyre]], [[Hursthouse]], [[Sandler]], [[Foot]], [[Anscombe]]

### VE Accounts for Moral Development
There is no one age where children begin to act "on principle." Instead, moral development begins to look like starting to understand the reason for the 'mothers knee' rules taught from childhood. 

### Moral Uncodifiability Argument

### Argument from Exceptionality
Using virtue ethics, we can better account for the expectations of others to do the right thing. If someone is poor and ought to return a purse they found on the floor, when they do so, it reflects much more strongly on their character than a rich person in the same situation. It took muhc more honesty and courage for the poor person to return the purse, meanig they likely have a stronger character. Agent neutral or duty based ethics cannot accoutn for this nuance. ([[On Virtue Ethics]], 97)

### Virtue Ethics Accounts for Edge Cases
In the film American History X, the main character characteristically acts with honesty and charity to those within his community, but at the same time, harbors antisemetic and racist beliefs about others. Claims of principled moral motivation or cognitive recognition of duty clearly do not work to understand him, but with Virtue Ethics, we can take him apart to understand why he acts the way he does. With Norton's character we can say "He is quite charitable and honest, but he has quite a large blind spot when it comes to his beliefs about jewish people and black people."

### Argument from Practicality
See A2 Virtue Ethics Fails in Motivation below
See [[Hursthouse]]
Virtue Ethics very easily escapes the [[Plato]]nistic Fallacy saying that one can only learn how to be good by spending their time learnig moral theory. In other words, ethics can be practiced by lay people just as it can be by people in the ivory tower.

Christine [[Korsgaard]] cites an amsing example of [[Kant]] falling into this trap.
	"Everyone does, in fact, decide by this rule whether actions are morally good or bad. Thus *people* ask: If one belonged to such an order of things that anyone would allow himself to deceive when he thought it to his advantage ... would he assent of his own will to being a member of such an order of things?'"
People do not ask this, like, ever.

Because Virtue Ethcics uses X reasons for V acts (See A2 Virtue Ethics Fails in Motivation below), Virtue Ethicists can easily accommodate for how we do ethics in daily life. Because reasons for action dont have to be infinitely complex or convoluted, we can actually call normal people acting from a good motivation. without needing to read the *Groundwork*. ([[On Virtue Ethics]], 137)

### VE Accounts for Emotions
See [[Anscombe]], [[Hursthouse]]
 According to [[Hursthouse]], in Virtue Ethics there are correct emotions (*re*actions) in different situations. These correct emotions have intrinsic moral value (Correct in this sense means something similar to "What is the capital of NZ? Wellington"). This has the appeal of not only providing a normative framework, but also creating an account for the philosophy of psychology that allows much more nuance in our ethical reasoning. 
	 A2: People may be well aware of their wrong emotions but are unable to control them. I may be irrationally mad at my can opener for cutting me, but that doesnt mean I want to. Ought implies can, therefore emotions like this cannot have moral value.
		 A2A2: [[Hursthouse]]: As [[Aristotle]] says, there are two parts to the nonrational soul: One nutritive and one desiderative. Only the latter has moral content. ([[On Virtue Ethics]], 110)
		 A2A2: [[Hursthouse]]: Emotional reactions are taught: the racist learns a wide variety of emotions towards a minority group through inculcation. The reactions of disgust, shame, hatred, etc are all learned and can be unlearned through time. At the same time, these reactions are *incorrect* as the basis for these reasons is that the minority group somehow deserves to be hated (which is empirically wrong) ([[On Virtue Ethics]], 114)
			 A2A2A2: How do hardcore fetishes (Rape play, knife play, race play, etc) fit into a virtue ethical perspective without kinkshaming?
	 A2: If emotions contain evaluative judgements, then animals and toddlers make moral decisions every day, which is odd to say the least given that they are not moral agents. Can we really morally blame a dog for barking at the mail man?

## A2 Virtue Ethics

### VE is Agent Based, not Action Based
Morality ought to tell me what actions I ought to do, not what kind of person I ought to be. Thus, it doesnt seem like VE can really be considered moral theory in the same way that [[Utilitarianism]] or following [[Deontology]] can be
	A2: [[Hursthouse]]: What actions one ought to do is of the concern of Virtue Ethicists, just one level deeper. While VE focuses on what kind of person one ought to become, the crucial part of that becoming is doing the actions that the kind of person one ought to be does. ([[On Virtue Ethics]], 27)
	A2: [[Hursthouse]]: This same critique could be made of Act [[Utilitarianism]] or [[Kant]]ian Ethics (EG "An action is right iff it is in accordance with a correct moral rule or principle.")

### Circularity
The statement "Some thing (x) is virtuous iff a virtuous person would do x." is circular! It tells me nothing about how to be a virtuous person. 
	A2: [[Hursthouse]]: Putting the central tenet incredibly obviously, there is no circularity. At *least* it is as circular as other normative theories.
		P1. An action is right iff it is what an X agent would characteristically do in the circumstances, and 
		P.1a. An X agent is one who has and exercises certain character traits, namely the Xs.
		([[On Virtue Ethics]], 30)

### How do I learn how to learn to be virtuous??
"But virtue ethics yields only the prescription, 'Do what the virtuous agent-the one who is just, honest, charitable etc.-would do in these circumstances.' And this gives me no guidance unless I am (and know I am) a virtuous If agent myself-in which case I am hardly in need of it. I am less than fully virtuous, I shall have no idea what a virtuous agent would do, and hence cannot apply the only prescription virtue ethics has given me." ([[On Virtue Ethics]] 35)
	A2: [[Hursthouse]]: it is fully possible to ask a virtuous person what they would do; and we do this frequently when we choose who to go to for advice. ([[On Virtue Ethics]] 35)
	A2: [[Hursthouse]]: If we understand honesty to be an example of a virtue, could one not understand 'be more honest' as something to strive for, even if imperfect themselves? ([[On Virtue Ethics]] 36)

### Virtue Ethics is Uncodifiable
The task of normative ethics is to come up with a set of universal rules that could create a decision procedure and explicit. Virtue ethics shrugs both of these concerns, thus making it a bad normative theory. 
Building on this, if VE is truly uncodifiable, there will be no decision procedure for individuials. there is no way to rank values 
A2: [[Hursthouse]]: The project of creating a codifiable ethic has largely failed, there are no theories that give a substantiative ranked set of principles.
A2: Morality cannot be codified as per [[GÃ¶del's Incompleteness Theorem]].
	A2A2: #MyArgument for the codifiability of VE: Because there are finite possible actions that humans can do (as humans are finite beings), all moral action is a limited set. Thus, although it would be impractical to codify virtue ethics, it would be possible. Thus even under VE, what one ought to do is codifiable (logically able to be codified).

### The Conflict Problem
Tragic dilemmas, situations from which, perforce, the agent emerges with dirty hands, are situations in which the supposedly charitable, honest, just ... agent is forced to act callously, dishonestly, unjustly ... But if someone acts callously or dis honestly... , she cannot be charitable or honest ... ; that would be a contradiction. So, if there are tragic dilemmas then no one can really be charitable or honest or ... ; no one can really have those character traits. There cannot be such a thing as a virtuous agent.
	A2: [[Hursthouse]]: The virtous agent in such a situation does NOT act viciously, that is, as a viscious person would. They act with immense regret, pain, and empathy. The virtous agent does not act badly in these situations; they acted the best they could for this situation. In orther words, the viruous agent may lie while not being dishonest, may run and hide but not be cowardly. 

### Virtue Ethics is Emperical
When doing VE, you look around the world to see who is a virtuous person and who is actually acting well. From there, ex hypothesi, you draw out some of the characteristics of this person and call them virtuous. Therefore, if someone does not know a virtuous person, they will have no moral guide on how to act.
	The terms of virtue ethics (honesty, charity, courage, etc) can very well be defined independently and dont strictly rely on people with these character traits. We can say "Being honest is telling the truth in stituations like X, Y, and Z. Person A is an incredible example of this character trait" ([[On Virtue Ethics]], 80) 

### Virtue Ethics is too loose
Because Virtue Ethics self-admittedly forgoes principles, this means that there could be a number of instances of people acting well that dont fit into the scope of ethics. In other words, Virtue Ethics says far too little of what it means to be a good person. 
	VE does have incredibly firm principles, just not in the way deontologists or utilitarains concieve of principles. The virtue ethicist has hard and fast principles that ought never be broken such as "Don't be dishonest" and "Be courageous" Even though VE doesnt have hard and fast *rules* of action, that doesnt mean the postion is unprincipled. ([[On Virtue Ethics]], 85)

### Virtue Ethics Fails in Motivation
As outlined in [[Kant]]'s work, the proper moral motivation is acting purely from duty rather than in accordance with it (See [[Deontology]]). If something is done because it would please the agent to do so or because they have an emotional attatchment to it, that seems to be the wrong kind of motivation -- yet virtue ethics precisely supports these reasons for action. 
	A2: Something is virtuous insofar as it is done for a reason that supports the virtues. If someone does something because it was the courageous thing, the honest thing, or the charitable thing, then they have done so for the right reasons. The following is a decent definition of a virtuous action done for a virtuous reason from [[Hursthouse]] 
		"'The virtuous agent chooses virtuous actions "for their own sake"' means 'the virtuous agent chooses virtuous actions for at least one of a certain type or range of reasons, X', where 'the type or range X' is typical of, and differs according to, whichever virtue is in question." ([[On Virtue Ethics]], 127-128).
		Or, " The V agent chose the V act *qua* V" ([[On Virtue Ethics]], 129)
		Some examples of a good reason for action (Reason X) are "She's my kid" "That's a lie" or "You need it more than I do."
			A2A2: But the reasons might be hollow or fvery temporary. Only though a recognition of duty can one be sure that one is doing it for the right reason.
				A2A2A2: [[Hursthouse]]: This is precisely the importance of character. If someone gives a good reason for doing an action once but fails to do it consistently, it obviously is not a part of their charavter.
	A2: [[Kant]] and [[Aristotle]] are much closer aligned than previously thought (See Below)
	A2: This argument is turned into a reason to *choose* VE above (See Argument from Practicality)

#### Connecting [[Kant]] and [[Aristotle]]
The perceived tension between their ethics: 
	While [[Kant]] favors the individual doing an action for the sake of duty, [[Aristotle]] prefers the individual doing an action because it is inline with their virtuous character. (Enkrateia vs Arete)
In reality though, [[Aristotle]] firmly holds that the virtuous agent is happy to do the right thing *because* its the right thing. What this means is that [[Kant]] and [[Aristotle]] both can have mutually inclusive conceptions of right action and right motivation. ([[On Virtue Ethics]], 98). 
[[Hursthouse]] maintains that [[Kant]] was replying to [[Hume]] in writing the passage on acting from duty. While [[Hume]] was saying that emotions need drive ethical action, [[Kant]] wanted to maintain that reason played a central role in ethical action. Virtue ethicists agree.
