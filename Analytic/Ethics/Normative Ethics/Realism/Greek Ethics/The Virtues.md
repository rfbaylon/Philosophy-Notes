			A2: If this is true, then we would also need to grant courage to the basest of animals and children
				Laches 196e
			A2: Fears and hopes look forward, but it seems possible to be courageous given present or past circumstances. Does this then mean that courage is the understanding of all goods and evils? If this is the case, we are no longer talking about part of a virtue, but virtue simpliciter.
