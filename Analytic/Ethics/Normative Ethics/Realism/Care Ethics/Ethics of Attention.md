See [[Weil]], [[Murdoch]], [[Odell]], 

Attention is a "just and loving gaze directed upon an individual reality - the characteristic and proper mark of the moral agent" 
	[[Sovereignty of Good]], loc 719ish

"Virtue is good habit and dutiful action, but the background is a just vision and good conscience."
	[[Sovereignty of Good]], loc 1515
#### Linguistic Background
All language (including moral language) depends on contexts and politics of attention. Each word has a specific tone, slant, or meaning that draws attention to different parts of the same object. This attention to particular parts of objects is normative, as all attention is.
	[[Sovereignty of Good]], loc 664

### Methods of Moral Improvement
See [[Murdoch]]
1. Beauty
	See [[Moral Aesthetics]]
2. Techne
	When someone studies a certain craft, they need to have all of the virtues in order to do the craft well. Truly understanding a craft allows you to connect deeper to its minutia and reality beyond appearance.
		[[Sovereignty of Good]], loc 1483
3. Contemplation of the Good
	Increasing awareness of goods and attempting to attend to them purely brings with it increasing awareness of the world.
## What is the Good?

The Good shares the characteristics that God traditionally has:
"a single perfect transcendent nonrepresentable and necessarily real object of attention"
	[[Sovereignty of Good]], loc 982

**1. Single, Unitary**
	See [[Virtue Ethics#Unity of the Virtues]]
**2. Perfect**
	We know that there is perfection because we know there is improvement. If we can say that A is better than B, we know that there is an ideal limit to the kinds of things A and B are. Virtues are not perfection themself, but arrows pointing towards perfection
		[[Sovereignty of Good]], loc 1085
**3. Transcendent**
	Goodness, as perfection, is unable to be grasped by our limited concepts of our inexhaustible world. Transcendence of the imperfect self needs to be realized to know the Good
**4. Non-representable**
	The goodness is the light that makes the world viewable in the first place. [[Murdoch]] uses [[Plato]]'s allegory of the cave to draw a connection to the Good as the sun. The sun, something impossible to look at with bare eyes, shines the light on the world as it is. The fire within the cave that illuminates the shadows is the false sun, the false Good (Religion, Reason, Science, etc) that is much more easily seen.
	"The source of vision is not in the ordinary sense seen" #Quote 
		[[Sovereignty of Good]], loc 1608
**5. Necessary**
	The Good is necessary as it is the world as it really is. The world could not be the world without the proper conception of it. Seeing the world correctly to [[Murdoch]] is both normative and descriptive. "The necessity of Good is then an aspect of the kind of necessity involved in any technique for exhibiting fact"
		[[Sovereignty of Good]], loc 1205
**6. Object of Attention**
	It is natural for humans to focus on that which is a source of energy. For example, falling out of love is not using an off switch, but redirecting attention towards other objects. The love always stays, just redirected. 
	"Falling out of love is not a jump of the will, its the acquiring of new objects of attention and thus new energies as a result of refocusing" #Quote
