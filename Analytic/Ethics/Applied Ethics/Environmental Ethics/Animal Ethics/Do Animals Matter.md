### Selfhood Creates Value
Animals genuinely are self directed creatures, meaning taht they have a self, that 'there is someone home,' (Smuts). 

## A2 Rightist Views

### Attack from [[Deep Ecology]]
If we grant individual rights to deer, when the deer are overpopulating a specific environment, we would have to bend to their individual wills for the harm of the greater ecosystem. Given these rights, we could not manage the population and would see notable decreseas in ecological sustainaibility and biodiversity.
	A2: Rightists will respond to this the same way [[Deep Ecology]] responds to charges of ecofascism! Its currently not OK to kill humans for the sake of ecosystemic integrity (even though humans are doing massive damage). The normal response is that ecological value must be taken into consideration, but not moreso than basic (human) rights.
	Building on this: this also leads [[Deep Ecology]] to an incredibly anthropocentric position: rights for humans but noone else.

Reasons why we have no particular reasons to care for animals

## Name The Trait
- What is true of animals that, if true of humans, would make it morally permissible to torture, kill, and eat them.

### Personhood
See [[Personhood]]

### Modal Personhood
See [[Kagan]]
If something is a person (Going by [[Kagan]] and [[Singer]]'s definition in [[Personhood]]) or metaphysically could have been a person, it is granted more moral worth than a nonperson. A modal person can only be said to exist if they are a part of a *person species.* This runs contra [[Singer]] who claims that intensity and duration of pain are the only factors that matter.
- Note that this argument does not mean nonhuman animals have *no* value, just less
	A2: What exactly is a person species? At what point does a "species" become a "person species"? when more than 50% of a species is a person?
		A2A2: [[Kagan]] nononono, its when the generic member of a species is a person [[What's Wrong With Speciesism]], 14
			A2A2A2: That is still an appeal to statistics. what the hell do you mean if not "normal" or "average"
	A2: Why even stop at species? Why not a genus? Phylum? Or even more out there, why not part of the set-of-things-that-X? For example, would a philosophy club honorarily making their pet rabbit make it part of a "person group?"
		A2A2: Those are artificial groups. What matters is natural groups. [[What's Wrong With Speciesism]], 14
			A2A2A2: how do you make a meaningful distinction between a natural and unnatural grouping? [[Wittgenstein]] would hate this argument.
	A2: Why draw the line at *metaphysical* modality and not logical modality? Or Biological modality? What exactly do you mean by *could have been*?
	A2: Even then, there is a metaphysically possible world by which rabbits could be persons.
	A2: The argument implies someone could be the same person with entirely different genes. This is an incredibly (at best) controversial claim in the study of identity.

### Reason
See [[Kant]]

### Reciprocation of the Social Contract
See [[Destiny]], [[Locke]], [[Hobbes]]

## Contingent Worries

### Cultural Imperialism

A2: There are intense parallels between the old claims that "multiculturalism is bad for women" and "multiculturalism is bad for animals" ([[Zoopolis]], 45)
