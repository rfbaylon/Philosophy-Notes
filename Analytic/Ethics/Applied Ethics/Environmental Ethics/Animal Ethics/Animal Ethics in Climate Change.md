### Argument from Climate Reparations
See [[Pepper]]
See [[Name That Trait]]
As humans cause rights violations to animals by bolstering climate change, they are then owed aid as a matter of justice. Just like rights to health, food, and life are pivotal in fully capturing how we ought to adapt to climate change for humans, similar rights ought to be captured for nonhumans. 
~~~
The GDA: The relevant moral agents have a duty to facilitate adaptation when ever rights to life, health, and subsistence are violated or threatened by anthropogenic climate change.
~~~

This includes making human adaptations suitable for animal health, facilitating adaptation through genetic engineering or assisted migration, and increasing nonhuman access to differing environments.

### Argument from Vulnerability
See [[Palmer]]
Animals are the epitome of skewed vulnerability: They produce no CO2 (or the least of any country, that is) but will undoubtedly see the worst outcomes from climate change. Though animals (like humans) are inherently vulnerable, climate change creates situational vulnerability.

#### Assisted Migration as a matter of justice?
*The* case study for assisted migration is the American pika, a small rodent that lives in western mountain regions. Because of climate change and their hyper sensitivity to temperature, it could be worth relocating them to a more fitting ecosystem
	A2: American pikas will be made more vulnerable when transported as reorientation to the new habitat will be substantial work
	A2: "assisted migration jeopardizes the negative rights to life, health and subsistence of the pikas being relocated, and ‘hinges on whether we can justify imposing ‘ risks on animals in order to prevent rights violations further down the line. - [[Pepper]]" (Assisting Wild Animals Vulnerable to Climate Change, 190)
An analogous example will be spaying cats: spaying produces a number of harms to individual cats but the benefit is to prevent them from creating lives not worth living. 
	A2: [[Regan]]: Spaying cats breaks some of their rights to not be messed with. Doing so for the mere welfare of future kittens would probably be wrong. 

#### 5 responses with the contextual view & Climate Change
1. There are degrees of obligations as it relates to climate change. The larger the harm humans do, the larger the obligation we have to prevent / remedy the harms.
2. It is incredibly difficult to track which parts of climate disasters are human caused. eg., How much of this flood is caused by anthropogenic climate change?
3. Some animals benefit from anthropogenic climate change! We would obviously not owe these animals anything in the way of preventing harm
4. In many ways, remedying harms will be impossible. There's really no way (that we know of) to reverse a drought or to dry a flood.
5. Assistance ought not create other obligations to others. For example, assisting in the migration of one species should not substantially impact the competition in the area of the migrating species.

### Intergenerational Climate Ethics
See [[Nolt]]
See [[Longtermism]]
Most of the discussions that occur are first and foremost focused on the goods of near term beings in how they will be impacted by climate change. This seems, in a word, short-sighted. In order to properly weigh the impacts of climate change on nonhumans ([[Nolt]] includes nonanimals as well), we need to consider how climate change will impact biodiversity and populations millions of years down the line. The species we lose will be permanent, and the expected drop of 30% in biodiversity will not be recovered within hundreds of millions of years. (Nonanthropocentric Climate Ethics)

### Climate Change is Good, Actually
See [[Tomasik]]
See [[Animal Welfare]]
Link to article: https://reducing-suffering.org/climate-change-and-wild-animals/
Climate change, [[Tomasik]] predicts, has a 50/50 chance of either being net good or net bad for wild animals. A net good would result in decreasing animal populations/biodiversity, and a net bad would result in increasing animal populations/biodiversity (The way CC would bolster population is via an insect boom). The biggest factor to take into consideration will be copepod suffering, as a small percent increase in population will lead to an incredible number of individuals (Important note: copepods have a CNS)

~~~
1 Average American's CO2 Footprint = [(16.4 metric tons)/(34.5 * 109 metric tons)] * 2% * (1012 mammals) * (1 assumed year of impact) = 10 mammal-years,

1 Average American's CO2 Footprint = [(16.4 metric tons)/(34.5 * 109 metric tons)] * 2% * (1018 insects) * (1 assumed year of impact) = 10 million insect-years.

#### Lower NPP -> Less animals
"If the instability also affects plants, then greater instability plausibly means lower total net primary productivity. With lower plant diversity, niches may remain unfilled, and total plant growth may be lower than what it could be given a more mature successional stage (although the relationship between seral stage and productivity [is complex](http://sciencebitz.com/?page_id=42 "'2.6. 6: Succession, Productivity and Diversity.' 'Mr G’s Environmental Systems'")). Lower net primary productivity means less energy with which to create suffering organisms at higher trophic levels."

#### Outcompetition by Bacteria
"The ultimate r-selected life forms are bacteria and other unicellular organisms, which we may care about less per unit of metabolism than we care about small animals. Instability that increases numbers of these kinds of organisms, and crowds out animal decomposers, may be good."
	A2: [[Sebo]]: There is a mistake in reasoning. What gives something a good life is not merely the net wellbeing over suffering, but there are also other factors such as meaningful projects, health, relationships, among other things. Some objectivist theories of wellbeing will claim taht animals may be living good lives, even if filled with suffering.
