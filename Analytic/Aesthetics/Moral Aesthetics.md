One of the primary ways of understanding ethics is through proper attention to the beautiful. Correct vision of the world unveils both its beauty and allows it to be properly ethically judged. 
	[[Sovereignty of Good]], loc 792

Primarily, contemplation of both natural beauty or artistic beauty are important for moral development. As you unselfishly observe nature and revel in its absurdity, you properly attend to the scene as it is. Similar with art. When art is unselfish and raw, it shows the world as is, drawing attention to the minute parts of the world that cohere into a unity.
