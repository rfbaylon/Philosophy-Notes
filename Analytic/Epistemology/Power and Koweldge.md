[[Plato]]: Knowledge ought to be power: those who know the most, who are the best philosophers, ought to be rulers as a philosopher king. 

[[Foucault]]
Knowledge and power are inexorably linked.
"that whenever one speaks of knowledge, one is also _ipso facto_ speaking of power, and whenever one speaks of power, one is also speaking _ipso facto_ of the systems of knowledge that uphold and maintain the power relationships in question."
