How can we learn something about an actual thing from studying a model that is entirely different?

There are 4 main views:
##Models cannot tell you anything about their referent

Models can tell you things about their refferent such that the properties of the model are held in virtue of properties that the referent has

Models can yell you things about their referent such that they are an idealized form of the referent

Models can tell you things about their referent such that one can translate model data into referent data
	If the model for a triangle has lengths A , B , C, and we know that the referent has lengths 3A , 3B , and x , we can safely infer that x = 3C as it was *translated* by a factor of 3
