[[My Stance]] on epistemic skepticism: We have to buy the argument that we cant know *for sure* whether or not we are being deceived by an evil demon. It is true. We have to take a leap of faith to accept that our sense data are somewhat reliable though in order to operate in the world. 

[[Descartes]]' argument for skepticism

1.  While we dream, we perceive dream objects.
2.  Sense data from dreams are not real.
3.  We can falsely believe sense data from dream objects to be real.
4.  There is nothing that meaningfully and rationally differentiates dream sense data from real sense data.
5.  We can falsely believe sense data from real objects to be false.
6.  Therefore, sense data is doubtable.

	A2:  if we learn logic empirically, and we cannot fully trust empirical knowledge (as per (5)), then we cannot trust logic itself, and thus we cannot trust the above proof. In essence, the proof is self defeating under an empiricist framework ([[Rationalism, Empiricism, & Idealism]]).
		A2A2: You rely on logic to build this argument.
