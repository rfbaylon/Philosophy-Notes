What impact, if any, do reason and emotion have on our decision making?

## A2 Classical Reason

### Reason is Socially Dependent
See [[Murdoch]]
Words in propositional phrases do not in themselves contain wisdom or teach. Words in specific contexts, times, and situations do. Reason does not function apart from an environment, but rather is embedded inside the social context
	[[Sovereignty of Good]], loc 648
	This links to [[Murdoch]]'s moral theory in [[Ethics of Attention]].

"Philosophy is often a matter of finding a suitable context to say the obvious"
	[[Sovereignty of Good]], loc 672
