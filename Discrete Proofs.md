## Existence Proofs
Anything with the form $\exists x P(x)$
(there exists an x such that...)
### Constructive Proofs
Find a witness. If you can find one example of an x that satisfies $P(x)$, the proof has succeeded.

### Nonconstructive Proofs

#### Proof By Contradiction
Proofs that make use of the fact that $\lnot (p \land \lnot p)$
Helps to start by assuming the thing you are trying to prove is false and showing that it leads to a contradiction


#### Proof by Contraposition
Proofs that make use of the fact that $p \implies q$ is equivalent to $\lnot p \implies \lnot q$

#### Proof by Smallest Counterexample
Combines a proof by contradiction and a proof by induction.
The steps are as follows:
1. Create a base case where the theorem is true

Example:
Theorem
1.   ∑y=0k3y⩾3k+1y=0∑k​3y⩾3k+1
