## Existence Proofs
Anything with the form $\exists x P(x)$
(there exists an x such that...)
### Constructive Proofs
Find a witness. If you can find one example of an x that satisfies $P(x)$, the proof has succeeded.

### Nonconstructive Proofs

#### Proof By Contradiction
Proofs that make use of the fact that $\lnot (p \land \lnot p)


#### Proof by Contraposition
Proofs that make use of the fact that $p \implies q$ is equivalent to $\lnot p \implies \lnot q$


## Direct Proofs
