## Existence Proofs
Anything with the form $\exists x P(x)$
(there exists an x such that...)
### Constructive Proofs
Find a witness. If you can find one example of an x that satisfies $P(x)$, the proof has succeeded.

### Nonconstructive Proofs

#### Proof By Contradiction
Proofs that make use of the fact that $\lnot (p \land \lnot p)$
Helps to start by assuming the thing you are trying to prove is false and showing that it leads to a contradiction


#### Proof by Contraposition
Proofs that make use of the fact that $p \implies q$ is equivalent to $\lnot p \implies \lnot q$

#### Proof by Smallest Counterexample
Combines a proof by contradiction and a proof by induction.
The steps are as follows:
1. Create a base case where the theorem is true

##### Example
Theorem: For all $n\geqslant 1$, $\Large\sum\limits_{y=0}^n3^y < 3^{n+1}$
1. Base Case: $n=1$ is true. It equals 9.
2. If the theorem is false, there exists a smallest counter example. Call this counter example $k$. $\Large\sum\limits_{y=0}^k3^y < 3^{k+1}$
3. Since $k-1$ doesnt correspond to a counterexample,
