### [Effectiveness of Statewide AAs](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236781952_Effectiveness_of_Statewide_Articulation_Agreements_on_the_Probability_of_Transfer_A_Preliminary_Policy_Analysis)
Anderson et al., 2006

Provides some evidence that transfer rate was uncorrelated with statewide articulation agreements. The date range for the data was 1989-1994. Statewide articulation agreements by themselves are not enough.

Please respond to the following in 1-2 paragraphs:

1) state where you are on co-op and then answer the questions you raised for yourself in Discussion Board Number 2 assignment
My coop is at the Center for Inclusive Computing. 
a. Mistakes? Yes. I really didnt schedule out my project like I needed to, leading to a lot of crunch at the end. I also didnt plan the project from the start as much as I should have.
b. Carla? CS Grad School! Carla is helping me out a lot by essentially scooting me into the grad program next year. Im so excited.
c. Skills? I picked up a lot of much better research intuitions, better coding skills, and much better writing skills. 
2) list 3 questions you still have about the job, even as you are ending your co-op, you should always be curious
a. Would I do this again, given the chance?
b. How can I plan out future research projects better?
c. Did I improve as a communicator and person? 
3) reflect on how this co-op will influence your choice of classes (assume/pretend you have space for some electives or the time to change your major or add a minor- what classes/major/minor would you choose after completing this co-op and why?)Â 
I am going to computer science grad school now! Due to my supervisor and due to the few coding projects I got my hands on, Im now super excited to code more in my day-to-day.
4) reflect on how this co-op will influence your choices for your next co-op or post-grad work- was the work space and environment/management style/workload/pace a good fit with your personality/interests/values- why or why not?
I really liked my coworkers and supervisors, but Im not convinced that pedagogy is where I want to end up. Though it is interesting and important, I cant see myself doing pedagogical research long term. 
5) did this co-op meet your expectations, why or why not? would you recommend this co-op to a peer, why or why not? if you would not recommend this co-op, how would you change it to make it stronger so that you would be able to recommend it?
It did! I think I would recommend the CIC to a peer, especially on the technical side. Awesome space, supervisors, and connections all around. For a student with my interests (which Im not sure were even well defined in the first place), Id say less so, but still go for it.
6) how would you describe your workplace in terms of inclusivity? were you involved in any diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives while on co-op- if yes, please describe. How could this co-op be more inclusive? Please provide 1-2 concrete examples supporting your response.
My work place was called the Center for *Inclusive* Computing, so it was pretty inclusive. Pronouns were respected, peoples voices were heard, and racial and gender data we were dealing with was dealt with sensitively. 
7) describe at least one "cool" project you worked on and/or one interesting person you met and at least one challenge you faced on this co-op
My *big* project was the Massachusetts Community College reseach paper, outlining the transfer pathways within the state for CC students. Next semester, its to be published, and, since we have a connection with the department of higher education, should influence policy which is cool.
