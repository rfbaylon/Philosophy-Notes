### [Effectiveness of Statewide AAs](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236781952_Effectiveness_of_Statewide_Articulation_Agreements_on_the_Probability_of_Transfer_A_Preliminary_Policy_Analysis)
Anderson et al., 2006

Provides some evidence that transfer rate was uncorrelated with statewide articulation agreements. The date range for the data was 1989-1994. Statewide articulation agreements by themselves are not enough.

### [Effects of Structured Pathways in CCs](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3102/0162373716651491?casa_token=UjivvghEZsgAAAAA%3A72SizJjDvXv-MkeqSV1mwc92mYnZsUerLKgan1hzfvXwmfkCzkD-L5LHT5TNLb8akAqgNgMCpShK)
Baker, 2016

High importance! Studied degree pathways in California had substantial (35%!) increases in graduation rates for transfer students after structured pathways (like those in MassTransfer) were put in place. This is a good paper to make the argument to expand MT. 

### [50 State Comparison](https://reports.ecs.org/comparisons/transfer-and-articulation-2022-03)
Education Commission of the States, 2022

Aggregates all state policies into one database. There are 35 states with statewide transfer agreements (of some sort), but not all of them are at all strong. 


### Unread, but maybe still good leads
[Statewide Transfer and Student Success](https://direct.mit.edu/edfp/article-abstract/13/4/449/12319/Statewide-Transfer-Policies-and-Community-College) (In depth look at Ohio's System)
[Importance of State Funded Web Tools](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ783939.pdf) 
[Tracking Transfer](https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/D8C24W80) (Transfer Metrics) (This one seems interesting for this stat, which I havent looked at in depth)
	"Institutional characteristics were not strongly correlated with student outcomes at community colleges, suggesting that institutions that serve transfer students well can have better-than-expected outcomes even if they have relatively few resources or more disadvantaged students."
