### [Effectiveness of Statewide AAs](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236781952_Effectiveness_of_Statewide_Articulation_Agreements_on_the_Probability_of_Transfer_A_Preliminary_Policy_Analysis)
Anderson et al., 2006

Provides some evidence that transfer rate was uncorrelated with statewide articulation agreements. The date range for the data was 1989-1994. Statewide articulation agreements by themselves are not enough.


### [50 State Comparison](https://reports.ecs.org/comparisons/transfer-and-articulation-2022-03)
Education Commission of the States, 2022

Aggregates all state policies into one database. There are 35 states with statewide transfer agreements (of some sort), but not all of them are at all strong.
