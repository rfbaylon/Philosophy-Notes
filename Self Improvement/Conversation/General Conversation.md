Conversation is all about searching for commonalities with another person. The reason the lame questions ("What do you do for work?" or "Where are you from?") are lame is because there is a really really low chance you will find a commonality, meaning there will likely be little conversation. 

Conversation is also an exercise in free association. When someone brings up a topic (e.g., steak), have in your head 3 associations (BBQs, seasonings, cows) which you can connect to it to expand the conversation.
	You can practice by choosing the last associaton and free associating off of that (vegetarianism, fields, milk) and keep doing that over and over again while figuring out how a conversation oculd go with each direction
