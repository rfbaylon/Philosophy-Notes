Overconfidence Bias
In doing anything, we need to be well aware of overconfidence bias. In studies ( #WIP need authors), its been shown that students vastly underestimate the amount of time it will take them to complete an assignment, routinely falling behind their *worst* case scenario time lines. Realistic goals make us more productive and efficient ( #WIP need reasoning here)
