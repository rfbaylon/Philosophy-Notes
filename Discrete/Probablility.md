Sample Space: the amount of possible outcomes

problem: Roll 10 dice. Whats the probability there are no 1s?
answer: the sample space is $6^{10}$ and there are 5 ways for each dice to roll a ~1. So there are $5^{10}$ winning possibilities. Thus, $\frac{5^{10}}{6^{10}}$
Another way, is $\frac{5}{6}^{10}$. The 5/6 justified as those are the odds of winning on one die.

Note that when a problem asks "what are the odds at least one person does x...", its much easier to find the probability that that person doesnt do x.

what is the probability, in a group of $k$ people, that one is born on may 9th? 
answer: $1 - (\frac{364}{365})^k$
