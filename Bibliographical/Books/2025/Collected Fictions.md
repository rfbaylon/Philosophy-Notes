**Your Highlight on page 37**
Whether profiled against a backdrop of blue-painted walls or of the sky itself, two toughs sheathed in grave black clothing dance, in boots with high-stacked heels, a solemn dance—the tango of evenly matched knives—until suddenly, a carnation drops from behind an ear, for a knife has plunged into a man, whose horizontal dying brings the dance without music to its end.

**Your Highlight on page 43**
The police, relieved, derived great amusement from his arrest; the judge prophesied for him, quite correctly, ten years in prison.

**Your Highlight on page 43**
He had been shot five times. A common alley cat, blissfully ignorant of death, was pacing, a bit perplexedly, about the body.*

**Your Highlight on page 45**
Beyond the setting sun lay the cedar-felling ax, the buffalo’s huge Babylonian face, Brigham Young’s top hat and populous marriage bed, the red man’s ceremonies and his wrath, the clear desert air, the wild prairie, the elemental earth whose nearness made the heart beat faster, like the nearness of the sea.

**Your Highlight on page 59**
spurned the advantages of that neglect, but his followers, his victories,

**Your Highlight on page 60**
Paradise was less concrete: It is always night, and there are fountains of stone, and the happiness of that paradise is the special happiness of farewells, of renunciation, and of those who know that they are sleeping.

**Your Highlight on page 64**
I was paired up with a girl that could follow like she could read my mind; the tango was having its way with us, whirling us this way and then that and losing us and calling us back again and finding us….

**Your Highlight on page 92**
Mirrors and copulation are abominable, for they multiply the number of mankind. I

**Your Highlight on page 93**
For one of those gnostics, the visible universe was an illusion or, more precisely, a sophism. Mirrors and fatherhood are hateful because they multiply and proclaim it.

**Your Highlight on page 98**
Hume declared for all time that while Berkeley’s arguments admit not the slightest refutation, they inspire not the slightest conviction. That pronouncement is entirely true with respect to the earth, entirely false with respect to Tlön. The nations of that planet are, congenitally, idealistic. Their language and those things derived from their language—religion, literature, metaphysics—presuppose idealism.

**Your Highlight on page 98**
For the people of Tlön, the world is not an amalgam of objects in space; it is a heterogeneous series of independent acts —the world is successive, temporal, but not spatial.

**Your Highlight on page 99**
For example, there is no noun that corresponds to our word “moon,” but there is a verb which in English would be “to moonate” or “to enmoon.” “The moon rose above the river” is “hlör ufang axaxaxas mlö,” or, as Xul Solar* succinctly translates: Upward, behind the onstreaming it mooned.

**Your Highlight on page 99**
There are things composed of many: the sun and water against the swimmer’s breast, the vague shimmering pink one sees when one’s eyes are closed, the sensation of being swept along by a river and also by Morpheus.

**Your Highlight on page 100**
Or to put it another way: space is not conceived as having duration in time. The perception of a cloud of smoke on the horizon and then the countryside on fire and then the half-extinguished cigarette that produced the scorched earth is considered an example of the association of ideas.

**Your Highlight on page 100**
The metaphysicians of Tlön seek not truth, or even plausibility—they seek to amaze, astound. In their view, metaphysics is a branch of the literature of fantasy.

**Your Highlight on page 101**
Of all the doctrines of Tlön, none has caused more uproar than materialism.

**Your Highlight on page 109**
Ten years ago, any symmetry, any system with an appearance of order—dialectical materialism, anti-Semitism, Nazism—could spellbind and hypnotize mankind. How could the world not fall under the sway of Tlön, how could it not yield to the vast and minutely detailed evidence of an ordered planet?

**Your Highlight on page 110**
It would be futile to reply that reality is also orderly. Perhaps it is, but orderly in accordance with divine laws (read: “inhuman laws”) that we can never quite manage to penetrate. Tlön may well be a labyrinth, but it is a labyrinth forged by men, a labyrinth destined to be deciphered by men.

**Your Highlight on page 117**
In the 1932 version of the novel, the fact that the object of the pilgrimage was himself a pilgrim cleverly justified the difficulty of finding Al-Mu’tasim; in the 1934 edition, that fact leads to the extravagant theology I have described.

**Your Highlight on page 128**
History, the mother of truth!—the idea is staggering. Menard, a contemporary of William James, defines history not as a delving into reality but as the very fount of reality. Historical truth, for Menard, is not “what happened”; it is what we believe happened. The final phrases— exemplar and adviser to the present, and the future’s counselor—are brazenly pragmatic.

**Your Highlight on page 129**
Fame is a form—perhaps the worst form—of incomprehension.

**Your Highlight on page 134**
In the cosmogonies of the Gnostics, the demiurges knead up a red Adam who cannot manage to stand; as rude and inept and elementary as that Adam of dust was the Adam of dream wrought from the sorcerer’s nights.

**Your Highlight on page 143**
That is the scheme of the Lottery, put symbolically. In reality, the number of drawings is infinite. No decision is final; all branch into others. The ignorant assume that infinite drawings require infinite time; actually, all that is required is that time be infinitely subdivisible,

**Your Highlight on page 145**
Another, whispered by masked heresiarchs, says that the Company has never existed, and never will. Another, no less despicable, argues that it makes no difference whether one affirms or denies the reality of the shadowy corporation, because Babylon is nothing but an infinite game of chance.

**Your Highlight on page 149**
With regard to this structure, it may be apposite to say once again what Schopenhauer said about Kant’s twelve categories: “He sacrifices everything to his rage for symmetry.”

**Your Highlight on page 153**
The universe (which others call the Library) is composed of an indefinite, perhaps infinite number of hexagonal galleries.

**Your Highlight on page 154**
Man, the imperfect librarian, may be the work of chance or of malevolent demiurges; the universe, with its elegant appointments—its bookshelves, its enigmatic books, its indefatigable staircases for the traveler, and its water closets for the seated librarian—can only be the handiwork of a god.

**Your Highlight on page 160**
Infidels claim that the rule in the Library is not “sense,” but “non-sense,” and that “rationality” (even humble, pure coherence) is an almost miraculous exception. They speak, I know, of “the feverish Library, whose random volumes constantly threaten to transmogrify into others, so that they affirm all things, deny all things, and confound and confuse all things, like some mad and hallucinating deity.”

**Your Highlight on page 161**
Methodical composition distracts me from the present condition of humanity. The certainty that everything has already been written annuls us, or renders us phantasmal.

**Your Highlight on page 161**
Those who believe it to have limits hypothesize that in some remote place or places the corridors and staircases and hexagons may, inconceivably, end—which is absurd. And yet those who picture the world as unlimited forget that the number of possible books is not. I will be bold enough to suggest this solution to the ancient problem: The Library is unlimited but periodic. If an eternal traveler should journey in any direction, he would find after untold centuries that the same volumes are repeated in the same disorder—which, repeated, becomes order: the Order. My solitude is cheered by that elegant hope.

**Your Highlight on page 166**
He who is to perform a horrendous act should imagine to himself that it is already done, should impose upon himself a future as irrevocable as the past.

**Your Highlight on page 173**
Unlike Newton and Schopenhauer, your ancestor did not believe in a uniform and absolute time; he believed in an infinite series of times, a growing, dizzying web of divergent, convergent, and parallel times. That fabric of times that approach one another, fork, are snipped off, or are simply unknown for centuries, contains all possibilities.

**Your Highlight on page 186**
He had effortlessly learned English, French, Portuguese, Latin. I suspect, nevertheless, that he was not very good at thinking. To think is to ignore (or forget) differences, to generalize, to abstract. In the teeming world of Ireneo Funes there was nothing but particulars—and they were virtually immediate particulars.

**Your Highlight on page 216**
like every writer, he measured other men’s virtues by what they had accomplished, yet asked that other men measure him by what he planned someday to do.

**Your Highlight on page 226**
God was made totally man, but man to the point of iniquity, man to the point of reprobation and the Abyss.

**Your Highlight on page 244**
As he crossed the threshold, he felt that on that first night in the sanatorium, when they’d stuck that needle in him, dying in a knife fight under the open sky, grappling with his adversary, would have been a liberation, a joy, and a fiesta.

**Your Highlight on page 253**
I do not want to describe it; a chaos of heterogeneous words, the body of a tiger or a bull pullulating with teeth, organs, and heads monstrously yoked together yet hating each other—those might, perhaps, be approximate images.

**Your Highlight on page 255**
I reflected that Argos and I lived our lives in separate universes; I reflected that our perceptions were identical but that Argos combined them differently than I, constructed from them different objects; I reflected that perhaps for him there were no objects, but rather a constant, dizzying play of swift impressions. I imagined a world without memory, without time; I toyed with the possibility of a language that had no nouns, a language of impersonal verbs or indeclinable adjectives.

**Your Highlight on page 257**
There is nothing very remarkable about being immortal; with the exception of mankind, all creatures are immortal, for they know nothing of death.

**Your Highlight on page 258**
Like CorneliusAgrippa, I am god, hero, philosopher, demon, and world—which is a long-winded way of saying that I am not.

**Your Highlight on page 259**
Death (or reference to death) makes men precious and pathetic; their ghostliness is touching; any act they perform may be their last; there is no face that is not on the verge of blurring and fading away like the faces in a dream. Everything in the world of mortals has the value of the irrecoverable and contingent.

**Your Highlight on page 261**
I have been Homer; soon, like Ulysses, I shall be Nobody; soon, I shall be all men—I shall be dead.

**Your Highlight on page 285**
I’m looking for the face I had Before the world was made. Yeats, “The Winding Stair”

**Your Highlight on page 310**
To die for a religion is simpler than living that religion fully; battling savage beasts in Ephesus is less difficult (thousands of obscure martyrs did it) than being Paul, the servant of Jesus Christ; a single act is quicker than all the hours of a man. The battle and the glory are easy;

**Your Highlight on page 321**
In Alexandria there is a saying that only the man who has already committed a crime and repented of it is incapable of that crime; to be free of an erroneous opinion, I myself might add, one must at some time have professed it.

**Your Highlight on page 322**
time, which ravages fortresses and great cities, only enriches poetry.

**Your Highlight on page 388**
In teeming marketplaces or at the foot of a mountain upon whose uncertain peak there might be satyrs, he had listened to complex stories, which he took in as he took in reality—without asking whether they were true or false.

**Your Highlight on page 396**
I close my eyes and see a flock of birds. The vision lasts a second, or perhaps less; I am not sure how many birds I saw. Was the number of birds definite or indefinite? The problem involves the existence of God. If God exists, the number is definite, because God knows how many birds I saw. If God does not exist, the number is indefinite, because no one can have counted.

**Your Highlight on page 426**
The images in dreams, wrote Coleridge, figure forth the impressions that our intellect would call causes; we do not feel horror because we are haunted by a sphinx, we dream a sphinx in order to explain the horror that we feel.

**Your Highlight on page 430**
Spinoza believed that all things wish to go on being what they are—stone wishes eternally to be stone, and tiger, to be tiger. I shall endure in Borges, not in myself (if, indeed, I am anybody at all), but I recognize myself less in his books than in many others’, or in the tedious strumming of a guitar.

**Your Highlight on page 447**
I want to die completely; I want to die with this body, my companion.

**Your Highlight on page 477**
Those who read the news each morning do so simply to forget it again, or for the sake of the evening’s conversation, and so it should surprise no one that people no longer remember, or remember as though in a dream, the once-famous and much-discussed case of Maneco Uriarte and a man named Duncan.

**Your Highlight on page 484**
Maneco Uñarte did not kill Duncan; it was the weapons, not the men, that fought. They had lain sleeping, side by side, in a cabinet, until hands awoke them. Perhaps they stirred when they awoke; perhaps that was why Uriarte’s hand shook, and Duncan’s as well. The two knew how to fight—the knives, I mean, not the men,

**Your Highlight on page 487**
Your father, rest his soul, told us once that time can’t be measured in days the way money is measured in pesos and centavos, because all pesos are equal, while every day, perhaps every hour, is different.

**Your Highlight on page 508**
Silveira was very fond of the dog, and had named it Thirty-three.*

**Your Highlight on page 548**
My story will be faithful to reality, or at least to my personal recollection of reality, which is the same thing.

**Your Highlight on page 573**
I felt what we always feel when someone dies—the sad awareness, now futile, of how little it would have cost us to have been more loving.

**Your Highlight on page 579**
In order truly to see a thing, one must first understand it. An armchair implies the human body, its joints and members; scissors, the act of cutting. What can be told from a lamp, or an automobile? The savage cannot really perceive the missionary’s Bible; the passenger does not see the same ship’s rigging as the crew. If we truly saw the universe, perhaps we would understand it.

**Your Highlight on page 603**
He called it “Utopia,” a Greek word

**Your Highlight on page 607**
When a man is the master of own life, he is also the master of his death.” “Is that a quotation?” I asked. “Of course. There is nothing but quotations left for us. Our language is a system of quotations.”

**Your Highlight on page 643**
A famous poem by Blake paints the tiger as a fire burning bright and an eternal archetype of Evil; I prefer the Chesterton maxim that casts the tiger as a symbol of terrible elegance.
