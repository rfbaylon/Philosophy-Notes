That is the first thing to learn—not to seek. When you seek you are really only window-shopping.

**Your Highlight on page 12**
Truth has no path, and that is the beauty of truth, it is living. A dead thing has a path to it because it is static, but when you see that truth is something living, moving, which has no resting place, which is in no temple, mosque or church, which no religion, no teacher, no philosopher, nobody can lead you to—then you will also see that this living thing is what you actually are—your anger, your brutality, your violence, your despair, the agony and sorrow you live in.

If you try to study yourself according to another you will always remain a secondhand human being.

**Your Highlight on page 20**
learning by watching and listening, learning by seeing and doing, then you will find that learning is a constant movement without the past.

**Your Highlight on page 21**
A confident man is a dead human being.

‘That is an oak tree’, or ‘that is a banyan tree’, the naming of the tree, which is botanical knowledge, has so conditioned your mind that the word comes between you and actually seeing the tree?

**Your Highlight on page 28**
Concentration is exclusion; attention, which is total awareness, excludes nothing.

**Your Highlight on page 30**
Verbally we can go only so far: what lies beyond cannot be put into words because the word is not the thing. Up to now we can describe, explain, but no words or explanations can open the door. What will open the door is daily awareness and attention—awareness of how we speak, what we say, how we walk, what we think.

**Your Highlight on page 33**
Thought is never new, for thought is the response of memory, experience, knowledge.

**Your Highlight on page 34**
Have you noticed when you have been denied the pleasure of drinking or smoking or sex or whatever it is—have you noticed what battles you go through?

**Your Highlight on page 37**
The saint who seeks a position in regard to his saintliness is as aggressive as the chicken pecking in the farmyard.

**Your Highlight on page 41**
One of the functions of thought is to be occupied all the time with something. Most of us want to have our minds continually occupied so that we are prevented from seeing ourselves as we actually are. We are afraid to be empty. We are afraid to look at our fears.

**Your Highlight on page 44**
the observer is merely a bundle of ideas and memories without any validity or substance,

**Your Highlight on page 59**
There is what is only when there is no comparison at all, and to live with what is, is to be peaceful.

that the very nature of desire, if not properly understood,

**Your Highlight on page 60**
that the very nature of desire, if not properly understood, must inevitably lead to conflict.

**Your Highlight on page 64**
Freedom is a state of mind—not freedom from something but a sense of freedom, a freedom to doubt and question everything and therefore so intense, active and vigorous that it throws away every form of dependence, slavery, conformity and acceptance.

**Your Highlight on page 65**
But the moment you get used to it—get used to your own anxiety or envy or whatever it is—you are no longer living with it. If you live by a river, after a few days you do not hear the sound of the water any more, or if you have a picture in the room which you see every day you lose it after a week.

**Your Highlight on page 70**
You cannot be frightened of the unknown because you do not know what the unknown is and so there is nothing to be frightened of.

**Your Highlight on page 71**
To live completely, wholly, every day as if it were a new loveliness, there must be dying to everything of yesterday, otherwise you live mechanically, and a mechanical mind can never know what love is or what freedom is.

**Your Highlight on page 72**
empty of its daily longings, pleasures and agonies. Death

**Your Highlight on page 72**
empty of its daily longings, pleasures and agonies. Death is a renewal, a mutation, in which thought does not function at all because thought is old. When there is death there is something totally new. Freedom from the known is death, and then you are living.

**Your Highlight on page 76**
So when one loves there must be freedom, not only from the other person but from oneself.

**Your Highlight on page 76**
In duty there is no love. The structure of duty in which the human being is caught is destroying him.

**Your Highlight on page 77**
Really to care is to care as you would for a tree or a plant, watering it, studying its needs, the best soil for it, looking after it with gentleness and tenderness—but when you prepare your children to fit into society you are preparing them to be killed. If you loved your children you would have no war.

**Your Highlight on page 81**
It means that you are not seeking, not wanting, not pursuing; there is no centre at all. Then there is love.

**Your Highlight on page 82**
‘Love has no tomorrow and no yesterday’, or, ‘When there is no centre then there is love’,

There is a story of a religious teacher who used to talk every morning to his disciples. One morning he got on to the platform and was just about to begin when a little bird came and sat on the window sill and began to sing, and sang away with full heart. Then it stopped and flew away and the teacher said, ‘The sermon for this morning is over’.

**Your Highlight on page 83**
Have you ever experimented with looking at an objective thing like a tree without any of the associations, any of the knowledge you have acquired about it, without any prejudice, any judgement, any words forming a screen between you and the tree and preventing you from seeing it as it actually is?

**Your Highlight on page 84**
It is only a mind that looks at a tree or the stars or the sparkling waters of a river with complete self-abandonment that knows what beauty is, and when we are actually seeing we are in a state of love.

**Your Highlight on page 94**
Ideas have become far more important to us than action—ideas so cleverly expressed in books by the intellectuals in every field.

**Your Highlight on page 95**
Thought in its demand for pleasure brings its own bondage.

There is a rather nice story of two monks walking from one village to another and they come upon a young girl sitting on the bank of a river, crying. And one of the monks goes up to her and says, ‘Sister, what are you crying about?’ She says, ‘You see that house over there across the river? I came over this morning early and had no trouble wading across but now the river has swollen and I can’t get back. There is no boat.’ ‘Oh,’ says the monk, ‘that is no problem at all’, and he picks her up and carries her across the river and leaves her on the other side. And the two monks go on together. After a couple of hours, the other monk says, ‘Brother, we have taken a vow never to touch a woman. What you have done is a terrible sin. Didn’t you have pleasure, a great sensation, in touching a woman?’ and the other monk replies, ‘I left her behind two hours ago. You are still carrying her, aren’t you?’

Thus we see it is not control that leads to quietness

the recognition of an experience must inevitably be old.

Meditation is not following any system; it is not constant repetition and imitation. Meditation is not concentration. It is one of the favourite gambits of some teachers of meditation to insist on their pupils learning concentration—that is, fixing the mind on one thought and driving out all other thoughts. This is a most stupid, ugly thing, which any schoolboy can do because he is forced to.

**Your Highlight on page 107**
Meditation is to be aware of every thought and of every feeling, never to say it is right or wrong but just to watch it and move with it.

the moment he says, ‘I know’, he does not know.

A man who knows what it is to have humility is a vain man.
