# Tips for Organizing

## Personal Tips for Organizing

- Back chain: Start with what you want the conclusion to be, and then follow backwards actions that will lead to that conclusion
- Prerequisite- Goals
	- What are your most fundamental values?
- Humans are not automatically strategic (Forum Post)
	For example, nobody ever looks up how to study best despite it being incredibly important. 
- Time and money are fungible: always try to compare opportunity cost as a factor of time and money.
- If something takes less than 2 minutes, do it immediately
- If you have an issue set an arbitrary time limit to focus all energy on it (Maybe 5 min)

### How to make foolproof plans
1. Make a plan for a goal you have
2. Imagine the deadline has passed and you failed to achieve that goal
3. Rate how surprised you are that your plan didnt work
4. Improve and/or change your plan
	- Do things with others
	- Penalties with external accountability
	- Rewards
	- Concrete time to do an action
	- Track and Stack functioning techniques 
5. Repeat 2-4 until youd be suffeciently surprised your plan didnt work


## Practical Tips for Organizing

### General Tips
- Small core membership is more important than large outreach. 
- Celebrate recognition of cognitive biases and practice thinking well
- Encourage disagreement (Look into Aumann's agreement theorem)
- Take ideas seriously
- Highly prioritize fun + community

### Successes and Failures of Other Groups

#### Successes
- If there are readings, do them together or summarize it in person
- Very short readings / reduced reading time
- Free food
- Free books
- Tabling
- Have a token social person
- Be adaptive when talking to people of different majors (change the pitch)
- Draw attention with outrageous EA hooks
- Eat at the dining hall on a specified date
- RetrEAts
- Involve faculty
- 

#### Failures
- Pushing books too hard
- Sugar-free boba
- Dismissing less effective charities/ hopes

#### Solutions
- EA Groups resources page on the website (need link)
- Global EA Group slack (need link)
- 


### Northeastern's Plan

#### Comms
Mailchimp?
Compile email list in spreadsheet
Put google form to get emails on some(?) website
Use already existing (but dead) slack/ graphics
Emphasize interdisciplinary philosophy and interdisciplinary work generally
Figure out how to table (even if not officially allowed) at fall fest

How to find people interested in EA:
- Posters around school
- Make announcements in affiliated spaces
- Word of mouth
- Make an event!
	- Solicit interest
	- Collet emails
	- Get a speaker like Juan or Julia Wise
	- It could easily 
MAKE A COHERENT STRUCTURE FIRSTs
**What evidence would persuade me that this would not be worth my time?**

#### Funding
If though working group, we get funding philosophy
UMAP is a group based EA funder that pays both me and the group
	Run by Open phil
	Paired with a mentor
	Apply for fall cohort
	Open phil also has fellowship related to organizers
OpenPhil also does this

#### Meeting
Syllabus for intro fellowship (sent to rfbaylon@ from Joel)
Mix in philosophy

BU people?????



# Maybe I shouldnt be making a EA club...

H1 Help out the Harvard Animal Advocates
	Start with Northeastern Vegan Club
	Do they want my help?

Community building outside of Northeastern?

H2 Practical Ethics WG
	Philosophers who are outside of EA might slam everything out of hand, make sure people have some background first...
	Juan is slightly pessimistic about this particular project
	More concrete action will probably be more helpful to the movement itself
	Dont take this too strongly 


Turn plans into foolproof plans after this retreat.

H3 Focus on own career, community building might not be the best for me. 

H4 EA Opporitunity Board

Keep options open!
