## Carbon Impacts

An all-electric Chevrolet Bolt, for instance, can be expected to produce 189 grams of carbon dioxide for every mile driven over its lifetime, on average. By contrast, a new gasoline-fueled Toyota Camry is estimated to produce 385 grams of carbon dioxide per mile. A new Ford F-150 pickup truck, which is even less fuel-efficient, produces 636 grams of carbon dioxide per mile.

## Water
EVs consume 50% more water than gas cars

## LIon Batteries

DOE says less than 5% of batteries were recycled in 2019

### Toxicity
"One study estimates that the potential human toxicity effects of the production phase to be between 2.2 and 3.3 times greater for BEVs than ICEVs... the toxicity effects are largely associated with disposal of mine tailings."

Further, many LCAs report that emissions of NOx, SO2, and PM from BEV production are approximately 1.5-2.5 times higher than ICEV production.

"In addition, the limited literature on terrestrial ecotoxicity suggests that BEVs and ICEVs have similar effects across their life cycle, dominated by emissions of metal particles from tire and brake wear during the in-use stage"
