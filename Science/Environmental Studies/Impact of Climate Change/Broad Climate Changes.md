It will take a long time to figure out the full impacts of weather and ecosystem changes as both may be expressed either far from the change and take a lot of time to happen. When it does happen though, it can be quick and irreversible.
	Examples: Fishery collapse, Species introduction, regional climate change, Disease, Eutrophication and Hypoxia.
