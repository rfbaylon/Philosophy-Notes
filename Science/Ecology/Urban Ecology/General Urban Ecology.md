## Major Strands of UE

### Ecology in towns and cities

- The study of ecological structure and function of habitats or organisms *within* cities
	- Includes impacts of human activities
### Human dimensions of urban ecology

- Study of the dominant social activities that drive ecosystem function and change including flows of information
- The varying impact of culturally based attitudes, values, and perceptions, and the creation and maintenance of institutions and organizations

### Ecology of towns and cities

- Study of urban areas as couples social-ecological systems, which includes humans living in cities and urbanized landscapes.
	- Examines entire urban areas from a social and ecological perspective
	- Recognizing the close links and multiple connections between the various parts of complex urban systems between form and function, urbs, civitas, and polis.
## Why is Urban Ecology important?
- Planning for and around ecosystem services
- Food supply planning
- Better understanding human and nonhuman disease vectors
- Determining environmental harms to dispossessed populations (human or nonhuman)
- Reducing urban pollution
- Mitigating impacts for surrounding environments
- Allocating urban water resources well
- Mitigating extreme events

## Ecosystem Approach
The city is an organism!


- Conservation of biodiversity (environmental sustainability)
	- When humanity's rate of consumption and waste does not exceed natures rate of replenishment and restoration
- Sustainable use of components (economic sustainability)
	- the ability of a society to uphold universal human rights and meet peplos basic needs
- Fair and equitable sharing of benefits (social sustainability)
	- ability of human communities around the world to maintain their independence and have access to the resources required to meet their needs.

Principles
1. The objectives of management of land, water, and living resources are a matter of societal choice
2. Management should be decentralized to the lowest appropriate level
3. Ecosystem managers should consider the effects of their activities on other ecosystems
4. Recognizing potential gains from management, there is usually a need to understand and manage the ecosystem in an economic context. Any such ecosystem management program should:
	1. Reduce those market distortions that adversely affect biodiversity
	2. Align incentives to promote biodiversity conservation and unsustainable use.
	3. Internalize costs and benefits in the given ecosystem 
5. Conservation of ecosystem structure and functioning 
	Regulating services
		Maintaining the quality of air and soil, proving flood and disease control, or pollinating crops are some of the regulating services provided by ecosystems. They are often invisible and therefore taken for granted. Damages can be difficult to fix.
	Supporting service
		#WIP
	Cultural service
		the nonmaterial benefits people obtain from ecosystems. They include aetehtic inspiration, cultural identiy, sense of home, and spiritual exprience. Tourism also falls under this
		Cultural services are deeply conterconnected with each other and often connected to provisioning and regulating services. Small scale fishing is not only about food, but also a fisher's way of life. 
6. The ecosystem approach should be undertaken at the appropriate spatial and temporal scales
7. Management must recognize that change is inevitable.
8. #WIP 
9. The ecosystem approach should consider all forms of relevant information including scientific and indigenous and local knowledge, innovations, and practices.

		TEK: Traditional ecological knowledge
		IKSPs: Indigenous Knowledge Systems and Practices

### Urban Metabolism
Look into UNESCO Man and Biosphere Program and LTER Network
#### LTER
Longterm, site based, ecological research and monitoring.

Goals of LTER
- Advance ecological understanding through development of ecological theory.
- To understand the structure and function of the urban ecosystem
- To make ecological predictions that can be used to guide future deveipment of human dominated environments while sustaining ecological values
- To involve the public in the research effort through dissemination of information via the media, public outreach and educational initiatives.

A framework using an organic analogy for studying the interactions of natural and humans systems in specific regions. It uses equations and models to describe and analyze the flows of materials.

It is a way of looking at cities that flow within a complex network of interlocked social and physical infrastructure. It conceptualizes the city as a living super organism in which there are continuous flows of inputs and outputs helps in the study of the patterns of movements of matter and energy.

Linear metabolism
- Taking in commodities, and having the used commodities leave 

Circular metabolism
- Reusing waste products as inputs for other production

Benefit of framework:
- Puts management of urban systems in hands of the people


### Vocab
*Urb* (Form): A physical entity, a place where human activities occur
	e.g., technical apparaus of urban infastructire (roads, rails, canals, sewers)
*Civitas* (Function): A sense of community, collective social involvement
	e.g., church communions, 
*Polis* (Function): Political part of urban functioning
#### Spheres
*Lithosphere*: Realm of rocks
*Pedosphere*: Realm of soil
*Hydrosphere*: Realm of water
*Atmosphere*: Realm of gasses, air
*Biosphere*: Realm of plants and animals
*Anthroposphere*: Realm of humans

#### Ecological Vocab
*Ecological Footprint*: Amount of land reqiored to produce the consumptions of one person or population. Measured in land-area (normally hectares) per person or per population. 
*Overshoot Day*: The date when humanotys demand for ecological resources in a year exceed the capacities of the Earth
*Biocapactiy*: The capacity of a given biologically productive area to generate an ongoing supply of renewable resources and support its waste.
*Carbon Footprint*: A portion of an ecological footprint. The total amount of greenhouse gasses emitted because of an individual's or population's lifestyle.
	Average carbon footprint for someone in the US is 16. The global average is 4 tons. The sustainable amount is 2 tons. 



Two major factors of urban areas
Form
	The source of materials and substances of the urban world
Function
	What humans do (The *Anthroposphere*)


## Impacts of natural processes in the Cityscape

Hazards
- Geographical location
- Climatic conditoin
- Geological situation
- Wealth of community
