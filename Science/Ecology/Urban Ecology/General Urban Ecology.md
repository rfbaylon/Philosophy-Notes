### Why is Urban Ecology important?
- Planning for and around ecosystem services
- Food supply planning
- Better understanding human and nonhuman disease vectors
- Determining environmental harms to dispossessed populations (human or nonhuman)
- Reducing urban pollution
- Mitigating impacts for surrounding environments
- Allocating urban water resources well
- Mitigating extreme events

	e.g., technical apparaus of urban infastructire (roads, rails, canals, sewers)
*Civitas* (Function): A sense of community, collective social involvement

*Pedosphere*: Realm of soil
*Hydrosphere*: Realm of water
*Atmosphere*: Realm of gasses, air
*Biosphere*: Realm of plants and animals
*Anthroposphere*: Realm of humans

#### Ecological Vocab
*Ecological Footprint*: Amount of land reqiored to produce the consumptions of one person or population. Measured in land-area (normally hectares) per person or per population. 
*Overshoot Day*: The date when humanotys demand for ecological resources in a year exceed the capacities of the Earth
*Biocapactiy*: The capacity of a given biologically productive area to generate an ongoing supply of renewable resources and support its waste.
*Carbon Footprint*: A portion of an ecological footprint. The total amount of greenhouse gasses emitted because of an individual's or population's lifestyle.
	Average carbon footprint for someone in the US is 16. The global average is 4 tons. The sustainable amount is 2 tons. 



Two major factors of urban areas
Form
	The source of materials and substances of the urban world
Function
	What humans do (The *Anthroposphere*)
