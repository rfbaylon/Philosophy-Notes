# Plants

## Origins
### Natural (ugh)
- Native
- Natural Plant Material Dispersal
### Anthropogenic
- Deliberate
- Accidental
## Lil guys
#### Fungi

#### Algae

#### Mycorrhiza
- help with fixing nitrogen in the soil
#### Lichen
- the symbiotic relationship between fungi and algae
#### Blue Green Algae
- NOT algae, they are bacteria.
## Big Guys
- Found in well planned cities

- Competition includes plant species that thrive in areas of low intensity stess and dustruabnce and excel in competing with other plants. Competitors are generally perennial and characterized by rapid growth, high productivity.
- Stress includes external factors that reduce production such as limited liught, water nutrients, etc. Stress tolerators are plants taht can live in intense conditions. 
- Disturbance refers to partial or complete destruction of the plant due to people, disease, animals, weather. Ruderal plants live in highly disturbed areas. 

## Urban Impacts on Flora

### Land Cover Change
- Habitat Homogenization: Reduced species richness and shift in community composition.
	Species richness: The presence of higher absolute number of species
	Species evenness: The distribution of those species
	Habitat homogenization is a decrease in species evenness.
- Higher presence of generalist, ruderal, invasive, and disturbance tolerant species
- Loss of animal-interaction relates characteristics, long flowering periods, fast growth rates, and demanding resource use strategy.
- Low pollinator service, pollinator dependent and self incompatible plants have low reproductive service
- Prevalence of abiotic pollination and dispersion. 
- Reduction of dispersal ability between fragments
- reduced genetic diversity (molecular markers described limited gene flow between urban and rural areas
### Climate
- Urban Heat Island
- Negative effects of temperature and water availability on plant physiology
- Higher abundance of non-native species adapted to warmer conditions
- Thermophilous (NOT thermophilic) species benefit
- Phenology refers to the timings of cyclical or seasonal biological events. Temperatures affect this timing, making them unpredictable for pollinators or other animals. 

### Pollution
- Contaminated soils cause structural injuries and reduced species richness
- The nigh concentration of soil contaminants and salts are detrimental to plant development, causing a reduction in growth by accumulating in roots, stems, and leaves.
- Higher leaf nitrogen concentration
	Nitrophilic species are plants that prefer to grow in soil that is rich in nitrates. 
- Associated arthropod biota affected through the reduction in vegetation palatability
- More stress-tolerator plants and weeds. 
- Air pollution associated with a decreas in the quality of seeds and plant growth. 
- Reductions in chlorophyll concentration are usually associated with air pollution decreaded photosynthetic rate
- The depositon of particulare matter on the leaveaves interrupted 
### Biotic Invasion
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Invasive species ([[Pests]]) arrive in areas and take over spaces by outcompeting with native plants.

	- Eg, kudzu, ficus microcarpa, scotch broom, 
- Non-native plants are not necessarily invasive. Invasive species are defined by negative interactions with consumers, pathogens, or mutualists. 
- Climate change is crufcial for establishing non native thermophilous species.
- Soil eutrophication and fertilization will also allow for more invasive species (specifically nitrophiles
- Humans bring ornamental or food plants wherever they go, meaning that human agency tends to assist invasion.
