# Atmosphere
## Concepts

Albedo: Ability of a survace to reflect light. Measured on a scale of 0-1, with black, absorbant surfaces being closer to 0 and reflective white surfaces being closer to 1.

Surface forcing: A measure of the influence that a factor has in altering the balance of incoming and outgoig energy in the Earth atmostphere system. A positive forcing warms the system, a negative forcing cools it. 

Urban Boundary Layer: The part of the atmosphere that is in direct inreaction with the earch surface and responds to surace forcings. The urban bountary later is the internal boundary layter formed when air flows over a city. 

Urban canopy layer: The atmosphere within  the assemblafe of buildings

Urban Canyon: A basic urban surface feature that is crated by tall buildings, giving the appearance of tall cliffs. The canyon air volume is the air contained within the walls, ground, and likd of the canyon. 

Urban dust dome: The dome of pilluted air that forms over a city during calm conditions as a result of the urban ehat island effect

Urban Heat Island Effect: The geneally warmer temperateures in urban areas than nonurban areas. 
	Factors that impact UHI:
	- building materials
	- surface areas of walls
	- vegetation
	- heath from anthropogenic sources
	- air pollution

Urban Cool Island Effect: In arid regions, urban areas may be cooler than surrounding areas.

## Chemical Pollutants

- Smoke: a collection of airborne silid and liquid particulates and gasses emitted during combustion or pyrolysis.
- Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) When sulfur is exposed to oxygen at high temperatures during fossil fuel combustion, oil refining, or metal smelting. Causes acid reain and aerosols.
- Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) Highly reactive gasses formed during combustion or lightning strikes. Also in fuel emmissions. 
- Carbon Monoxide (CO) an odorless colorless gas formed by incomplete combustion of carbon in fuel.
- volatile organic compounds  (VOC) hydrocarbons and other organic chemicals emitted froma  wide range of sources. Anthropogenic VOCs like benzene are known carcinogen
- Groundlevel Ozone (O3) Harmful secondary pollutant Formed in surface air by the oxidization of VOCs and carbon monixide in the presence of NOx.
- Smog: generic term for any kind of air pollution that reduces visibility. Usually photochemical smog or industrial smog
- Industrial smog: developed in cold and humid conditions. 
- Photochemical smog: forms when NOx and VOCs react i the presence of solar radiation to form ozone. Develops in summer. 
- Lead 
- Mercury: When materials containig mercury are burned as in coal comustion or waste incineration, mercury is released as a gas. 
- Other heavy metals: Include cadmium and copper, including lead and mercury are most importat. Harms througn inhalatioon or contaminated food or water. ALso contaminated soil. 
- Acid rain: Damafes vegetation and corrodes infrastructure. 

## Rain and Humidity
Cities create their own rainfall. Cities have more rainfall than rurual areas.
This is because:
* increases in hygroscopic nucleai
* Turbalance rrom increased surgace roughness
* Convectin because of increased temperatures
* and addition of water vapo by combustion processes

Wind convergence produced by urban dust dome is key factor in creating thuderstorms.
Once they develop, aerosols infuence the amoount of luqid water and ice present in the atmostphere. The surface precipitation totals, the strengh and timing of updrafts and downdraft. 

## Solutions
Using vegetation to reduce wind erosion. Windbreak are rows of vegetation designed to do this.
Benefits of windbreaks include:
	- Reduced soil erosion
	- Increased crop yield
	- Energy conservation
	- Snow control
	- Wildlife habitat
	- Beauty
	- Tree products
		Sloped windbreaks also include these benefits:
		- additional soil cohesion
		- increase in weight of soil
		- tensile reinforcement by roots
		- reduced force of the wind
		- higher soil strength

### Site Geomorphology
Requires sound understadning of the ground on which a city is built. 
Important to consider taht some sites are either built on glacial deposits, meaning they easily move, on solunble rocks, which pse risks for sinkholes, or are built on hills, posing risks for landlishes. Some sites, if built on clay, could even shrink.

Genesis of soils in urban areas differs from that of soils in rural areas. Most urban soils are "technosols"
Some of these technosols are Shea, Gravesend, and Bulkhead. Some soils are built up from landfills. 

Siltation is water pollution caused b particulate terrestrial soil materia. Refers to the incerased concentration of suspended sediments in water.

# Hydrosphere
Impervious sidewalks make it such that rain creates lots of runoff and little reintroduction of groundwater. 

## Solutions
Sustainable drainage systems (SuDS) asrea collection of water managemetn procatices that mimic natural water processes. Include retention ponds, detention ponds, and other methods described below.
- Trees help reduce runoff by 4-18%. This also redyces sream pillution.
- Green roofs absorb and utilize preciptation rather than sending it to sewers.
- Stream daylighting is allowing a stream to run above ground rather than above ground. This can support wildife, provide recreatetion, and provide stormwater runoff storage.
- Urban wetlands ameliorate the global problem of nutrient overloading.
