Human ecology is the study of the relationship between humans and their natural, social, and built environments.

It is a branch of sociology dealing with  the relationships between humans and their socioeconomic organization

The ecology of human communities and populations especially as concerned with preservation of environmental quality for humans

## Industrial Ecology

Substances are decomposed and reused in unnatural ecosystems and similar the byproducts of a factory may be reused in another. 

*Industrial Symbiosis* the association between industrial facilities using ones' byproduct as the primary product of another.
	Look into German concept of a *Verbund*, also mentioned in [[Writing Process]].

Connected to [[General Urban Ecology]] in that both are concerned with the use of hardware of the urbs relates to decision-making among the civitas and the polis.

## Landscape Ecology

Views built areas as a set of intimate landscapes of varying features and attractiveness, which, when put together, give a place character and identity.

Involves patches, corridors, matrices, and mosaics, which come together to form urban landscapes

It also considers both natural and anthropogenic processes such as stability, resilience, disturbance, regeneration, etc

patch
	A relatively homogeneous area that differs form its surroundings
	Basic units of landscapes that are highly variable
Corridor
	An area of habitat connecting patches which are separated by parts of the built environment such as roads and buildings. Allow exchange of individuals between populations and create resilience for populations
Matrix
	the background ecologcal sysgen within which the patches and corridors are set.
		The urban matrix for example is usually the built environment of roads, railways, and buildings.
		Essentially, a collection of patches. Matrices themselves can be patches if zoomed out.
Mosaic
	The pattern of patches, corridors, and matrix that form a landscape in its entirety.
	Connectivity: A measure of the closeness, links, and degree of spatial continuity of a corridor and networks of patches.

## Restoration Ecology

The scientific study of repairing disturbed ecosystems through human intervention. Supports the practice of ecological restoration which is the practice of renewing and restoring degraded, damaged, or detoryed ecosystems and habitats in the environment buy active human interruption and action. Aims to recreated the recovery of an ecosystem that has been disturbed.
