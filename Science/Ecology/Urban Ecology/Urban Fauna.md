# Animals
#### Kinds of animals
- Urban Strays (get food from humans)
- Birds
	To replicate cliffs, gulls in London reside on highrise buildings
	Albert Bridge in Northern Ireland is the home to a large community of European Starlings
- Pets
- "Food" animals
- Feral animals (hunt on their own)
- Urban aquatic species

- Urban insect

### Settling in Urban Habitats
1. Opportunities for colonization and number of sites that can be colonized ill be afected by the history of urban development
2. Biotic factors such as the availability and dispersal traits of potential colonists will be linked to the occurrence of urban populations
3. Factors such as human attitudes to urban wildlife and environmental quality
4. The acquisition of specific traits that increase fitness in urban environments by some species whos genetic composition permits them to express sufficient phenotypic plasticity
#### Sudden Human Caused Changes
Cosntructing btoh dispersal barriers and invasion pathwats through habitat fragmantation
Introducting exotic species and causing mass faunal extinctions
Chanfing exosystem stability by altering environmental constraints and biota
Manipulating disturbance regime by suppressing or increasing probabilies of occurance which affects #WIP 

#### Who Survives:
- Physiological tolerance for extreme variations
- Large zoogeographic distribution
- Generalists
- high reproductive rates
- Can tolerate human activity
- Frew competitors
- Toleration of highly fragmented landscapes
- High rates of immigration

## Urban Exploiters, Adapters, and Avoiders

As urbanization increases:
- Disturbance increases
	- Intermediate distrubance leads to highest species richness. This area is generally suburbs. 
	- Based on argument that dusrurbances continually disrupt the process of succession towards climax species in biological communities
	- Perturbations create pace for colonization by less competiive individuals. There is a tradeoff betweeen species colonizing ability and its competitive ability
	- Patches that are frequently and or intesely disturbed are expected to exhibit 
### Urban Adapters
species that take advantage of human provided resources but do not completely depend on them. They live in remnant woodlands, edges of urban areas, parks, etc.
- Take advantfe of areas where two habitats meet
- ;Rely on natural resources, but supplement from humans
- Common in suburbs
- Exploit 

### Urban Exploiters
Species that entirely depend on human provided resources in order to survive in an urban landscape.
- They are sedentary and their dietary habits change frombebing primaroty seed and fruit based to becoming more omnivorous
- Includes strays

### Urban Avoiders
species that are sensitive to changes in habitat that occur tiwht urbanization. They dont like it!
- First species to disappear in urban habitats


# Impacts on Urban Fauna

#### Adaptation
R species are the best at adaping to urban environments. 
	Case study: Peppered Moth in Manchester
	Monocytes are higher in urban house sparrows than in forests or rural areas. Monocytes are a type of white blood celll which lead to cancer and other autoimmune disorders

### Artifactual Collisions
25% of US bird species as having hit windows. In connecticyut, most strikes occur during autumn and spring. 
Car strikes peak in may-june during adult activity for the care of young. Occur mainly among species adapted to high human densities. 
Powerlines form another urban hazar. Powerlines near a cooling pond in Michigan killed 87 bird deaths from 11 species.

In LA, coyotes and bobcats that are most exposed to urban areas gain familiarity with cars and learn petterns.

### Food access
Urban areas provide food both indirectly at garbage cans and directly at feeders
In the US, 82 million people regurlary feed birds. 
Winter feeding can affect morality due to disease and pe=redation. Birds that use feeders are often better off. 
Among urban foxes, there are lots of worms. This is because they are common in voles and other rodents in urban areas.
	In some urban areas, foxes get vaccinated against worms ([[Wild Animal Ethics]])
Bears in nature roam up to 50 miles. Bears in urban areas travel up to 2. 

Predators canr each higher numbers in urban areas because of supplemental food. Thus, food provided by people can have a significant effect on the persistence of small bird populations. This is especially true of domestic or feral cats. 
Feral cats are now common in cities Rome has around 300k cats, but use policy to focus the cats only on rats (?)

### Noise
Wild animals view humans as predators, so they often respond to people created noise at levels that would not arouse domestic animals.

Sound is very important to most bird species as acoustic communication amy be critical for survival and reproductive success.
Anthropogenic noise may mask important signals and therefore singing behabior will be disrupted. 
	Studies found taht urban birdsongs of Parus Major were both shorted and sung faster. They also showed an upshift in frequency that is consistent with the need to compete with low frequency environmental noise (like traffic)
	A similar study found similar behaviors in song sparrows in Portland Oregon. The minimum frequency of male song sparrow song was positivelt related to the amplitude of urban noise. 
	Some species might also be able to alter their temportal pattern of calling, avoiding noiser times in the city

### Odors
Among nocturnal animals, odor is important for signaling and communication. Predators scentes may act as natural repellants.
People use smelling baits to vaccinate foxes.

### Light
Low pressure lights have far less impact on birds reptiles, and mammals. High pressure lights are pretty bad. 
LPS lamps are not attractive to moths because no UV light is emitted. 
As more different kinds of light are made, a greater variety of animals are impacted. 
Metal halide and LED lamps attract moths.
Predators and scabengers are more abundant under HPS streetlights than darker areas.
If there are more short wavelength lights, more moths will flock to those, disrupting proper dispursal of animals.

### Pesticides
Problems arise when pesticides affect nontarget species through direct contact, biomagnification, or synergistic interactions with other environmental contaminants. 
In 2013, the insecticide fipronil posed a high risk to honeybees whose numbers have declined rapidly. 

Influence bird populations by impacting birds growth development and survival as well as through reducing or altering the food supply.
In some instances insecticides have a profound effect on rpedatory bird population such as the Eurasian sparrowhawk. Other insectices have no evidence of large environmental impact against non target animals.
