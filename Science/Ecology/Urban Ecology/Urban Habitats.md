A habitat is the home or environment of an organism such as a plant or animal. Its the place whre the organism lives eats and breeds. 

Microhabitat is a small specialized habitat within a larger ecoststem
	e.g., 
	- The shady area under a tree
	- the underside of a tock in a stream
	- a clump of grass
	- a space between rocks
	- a decomposing log in a forest

#### Recombinant Ecology

Ecology of plant and animal communities that includes members from a wide range of geographic regions

## Habitats

Woodlands
- land spanning more than .5 ha with trees higher than 5m and a canopy cover of more than 10%

Remnant woodland
- a patch of long established woodland fragmented by other land use.

Brownfield Land
- Land that has been debelped for industrial or ommercial purposes, constructed, polluted, then abandoned.

Substrate
- The survace or material on or from which an organism lives, grows, or obtains its nourishment

#### Materials

Hard surfaces
	E.g., walls
		Over time, walls begin to gain lichens that begin to colonize. Over time, walls begine to decay.  As soil and organic matter accumulate in cracks, ferns and vascular plants can find a foothold. The larger plants accelerate the erosion of the wall. The floral of the wall comprises xerophytes.
	E.g., pavements
		nutrients and mosidture accumuilte in the gaps between pavement. This allows plants to sprout through concretes. Plants in the cracks get nutrients from the soil, but they also get it from lawn runoff.
	E.g., Roofs
		Any roof more than a few years old will attract mosses and lichens. Flat roofs have been used for recreation for a long time. Green roofs support a LOT of ecosystem services, including supportning many insect species, 


### Origins of Urban Habitats

Encapsulated Countryside
- semi-natural areas
- fields, meadows

Managed Greenspace
- anthropogenic areas that have human care
- golf courses, parks, etc

Naturally regenerating habitats
- The growth of plants in brownfields

Urban Wetlands
- Canals, wet grassland, amenities, ponds

# Impacts

Three distinct processes with different impacts occur in urban areas.
1. habitat loss
2. indigenous vegetation loss
3. habitat isolation
	Under these, there are many threats. Eg:
	- Toxic substances
	- Concentrated energy use
	- Automobile exhaust
	- Uncollected waste
	- Flash flooding

Tranformations from natural to urban land uses: Biodeiversity change and urban climate hcange alterations throug the heat island effect
- example: draining wetlands
- changing the design of formal open spaces

Fragmentation: it is used in the sense of patch dynamics, connectivity, and edge effects. In this sense, urbanization leads to a decrease in patch fragment sizes.
- microlimate, competition, herbivory, and seed dispersal

Edge effects: The changes in biodiversity taht occur inside the space surrounding the shared edhgeof two or more distinct ecoststems
- the transitional zone between two different ecosystems rich in biodiversity is known as the *ecotone*.
- In cities, the change between ecosystems is abrubt, meaning there are less ecotones in cities.
- Examples: a park next to a sewer gutter
- Highest species richness occurs in trnsition between cities and suburbs

Ecological traps!
Traps which occur when animals mistakenly prefer habitats where their fitness is lower than in other available habitats following rapid environmental change,, have important consrvation and management  implications

### Vegetation Habitats

#### Urban Forests
First, urban trees grow in difficult conditions. Lots of pollution , drought, high temperatures, poor soil, and limited root space

#### Urban Parks
Urban parks are green spaces in cities, suburbs.
They are areas of vegetation set aside for recreation. They can be managed by  private or public organizations. They define the shape and feel of a city and can also function as a tool for revitalization.
#### Urban Grasses
Eg., lawn, golf course, sports field, meadows, grasslands
Often disturbed by mowing, walking, or lots of chemicals

#### Domestic Gardens
Gardens that are attached to a house. Can be classified as mixed, kitchen, backyard, farmyard, compound, homestead.
Contribute to the larger green infrastructure network in cities.
#### Green Roofs
Any roof more than a few years old will attract mosses and lichens. Flat roofs have been used for recreation for a long time. Green roofs support a LOT of ecosystem services, including supportning many insect species., 
Require waterproofing membrane, soil, vegetation over a traditional roof. 
#### Urban Farms
Farms within urban areas, used to make urban areas more resilient. These will tend to use controlled environment or raised bed methods. More likely than not organic in order to reduce urban pollutants

##### Edible Landscapes
Landscapingt echnique that incorporates food producing plants into a residential landscape. Involves mixing food plants with ornamental plants

##### Hydroponics
Soilless farming taht utilizes nutrient rich water to provide plants with all they need for growth. Generally inorganic. Can be made organic if fish are added. This combo of fish and plants is called aquaponics.

##### Vertical Agriculture
The agricultural process in wihch crops are grown on top of eachother tather than intraditional horizontal rows. COnserves a lot of space. 

#### Urban Wetlands
*Lotic* (running water) and *lentic* (still water) systems comprise urban wetlands
Linear greatures such as rivers, streams, and canals are often ecological corridors which are important for biodiversity. There is less carbon in these systems and more oxygen.
Wetlands also have far above average biodiveristy. 

Lotic:
- There is less ability for plant roots to take hold 
- Higher erosion
- High oxygen levels, low carbon levels
- *Oligotrophy* may occur to lotic systems

Lentic:
- More affected by sedimentation and nutrient levels
- Low oxygen levels, high carbon levels
- *Eutrophication* may occur to lentic systems

Riparian zone is the interface between land and a river. 
- These are generally also ecotones.
- Characterized by hydrophilic plants
- act as natural biofilters and mitigate polluted runoff and erosion.
- SUPER high biodiversity


Marsh
	Shallow wetlands that can flood or dry out. Often only grasses
Swamps
	 Wooded marshes
Bog
	Acidic marsh
Fen
	


### What cause impacts? 
#### Cultural
In 1600s, tulips became fashionable as an expression of wealth. This lead to a lot of tulips being planted

- Lack of knowledge about the status and value of biodiversity
- Poor public perception and awareness of sites
- A change in ownership can elad to a change in maintenance or neglect
- Low publuc and corporate commitment
- Littering
- Overmanagement and simplification
- conflictin pressures for land use
- Impact of new developments
- Lack of financial or community resources
- Inappropriate management or use
#### Historical
As a city gets older, biodiversity goes down. More planning, infrastructure, etc happen which push out species.


### How to mitigate impacts?
 Green spaces!
 - Good for strom water retention and management
 - Nutrient recycling and management. Composting as an alternative means that waste can easily be used for more food. Waste water is also good for irrigation (though there are chances for contamination)
 - Habitat for biodiversity conservation. Builds ecosystemic resilience. 
 - Cultural services:  Functions as a place for social interations, community building, and civic engagement. Also a medium for learning.


### Tangent: Communities through Disaster

#### The Ecology of WWII
by 1945, rose-bay willow herb wa the most common plant in Central London after the blitz. This attracted elephant hawk moth
The next most common plant was Canadian fleabane

#### Fresh Kills Landfill
What used to be the largest landfill in the world in New York became a large park
