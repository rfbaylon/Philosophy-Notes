## Humidity

## Urban Heat Island
Structures like buildings, road,s and other infrastructure absorb and re-emit the suns heat more than natural landscapes.
	In the US, the heat island effect results in urban areas being 1-7 degrees hotter than suburbs in the day.
## Soil
Soils are compressed under concretes and tightened, resulting in less ability for water runoff to seep into the ground to make groundwater

## Water
There is more eutrophication in urban areas than other ecosystems. This is because there is a lot of phosphorus and nitrogen in urban sewage that enter water systems that leads to toxic algal blooms.

There is also a lot of groundwater usage in urban areas due to increased demand. 

## Relief

## Vegetation
To make space for buildings and other infrastructure, there is very little vegetation. 

#### Epiphytic Vegetation
Epiphytes are plants that grow on structures that are not parasites. Think  vines, orchids, mosses, ivies. 

In urban areas, there are very few epiphytes. Epiphytic vegetation is a very good proxy for ecosystem health. 
#### Ruderal Vegetation
Ruderal vegetation is vegetation that pokes through concrete or structures. Defined by not being a function of continued human cultivation. Commonly referred to as weeds. 
Mostly, Ruderal Vegetation are invasive species which are able to harm broader ecosystems.
#### Neophytes
An introduced plant species. Urban areas have much higehr rates of Neophytes.
