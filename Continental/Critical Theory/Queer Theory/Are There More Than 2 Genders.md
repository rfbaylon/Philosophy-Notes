## There Are No Genders
See [[Foucault]]

### Foucault
Gender and Sex are mere toys of biopower that have no accordance with reality, the proper political goal of feminism ought to be to dissolve these concepts.
	"The strategy has been not to enforce a repression of their desires, but to compel  their bodies to signify the prohibitive law as their very essence, style, and necessity" [[Gender Trouble]], 171

## There Are Only Two Genders

## There Are A Theoretically Unlimited Set of Genders
[[Butler]], [[Wittig]], [[Deleuze]] & [[Guattari]]

### Argument From Difference
See [[Wittig]], [[Deleuze]] & [[Guattari]]
while traditional psychoanalysis considers gender and sexuality in terms of lack, we need to push for an ontology of difference, based on the work of [[Deleuze]] & [[Guattari]]. The infinite replication of sex and gender, also, at the same time, negate the power of sex and gender creating a line of flight through heteronormativity
	"For us, there are, not one or two sexes, but many, as many sexes as there are individuals." [[Anti-Oedipus]]
	"This is not the figure of the androgyne nor some hypothetical "third gender" nor is it a *transcendence* of the binary. Instead, it is an internal subversion in which the binary is both presupposed and proliferated to the point where it no longer makes sense" [[Gender Trouble]], 162

### Argument from the Sex/Gender Distinction
See [[Butler]]
Because sex is dimorphous, that in no way implies that gender is also dimorphous as sex and gender have no bearing on each other whatsoever. A reification of the gender binary is a reification of the sex/gender distinction.
[[Deleuze]] & [[Guattari]]: If gender is culturally given to someone at birth depending on their sex, the sex of a child is the body without organs that is socially coded.

### Argument from nonutility
[[Butler]]
What utility is there to assigning genders to individuals besides the economic interests of heterosexuality?
"There is no reason to divide up human bodies into male and female sexes except taht such a division suits the economic needs of heterosexuality" [[Gender Trouble]], 143
	A2: Is there utility to divide nonhuman bodies into male and female sexes? 
	A2: What of the loss of economic, psychological, physiological data one loses when we abolish sex? Do these different categories not have any utility to researchers
