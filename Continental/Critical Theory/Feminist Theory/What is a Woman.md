[[My Stance]] on the definition of gender: I think Butler is right about gender performativity.

## Why have this concept?
1. The need to identify and explain inequalities
2. The need for a framework that is sensitive to similarities between men and women
3. THe need for an account that tracks embedded gendered social phenomena
4. the need for an account that properly takes seriously the agency of women

Two problems from the outset:

### Commonality Problem
It is going to be very very tough to find something that connects *all* females while excluding nonfemales. 

### Normativity Problem
Providing an answer to the question of "what is a woman"  carries normative implications that result in the empowering of certain women (as closer to the definition) and the marginalization of other women. 
	[[Gender Trouble]], Ch 1
	A2: [[Haslanger]]: If done well, it is a good thing that conceptualizing what a woman is has nomrative results. The hope is that these projects undermine patriarchy.

# Biological Essentialism

#### A woman is an adult human female (female defined by one's disposition to create female gametes (ova))

## Biological Essentialism


## A2 Biological Essentialism

### A2 BioEssentialism: Chromosomal Plurality
"A good ten percent of the population has chromosomal variations that do not fit neatly into the XX-female and XY-male set of categories" [[Gender Trouble]], 137
Thus, chromosomal distinctions cannot be what makes a woman a woman as that leaves 10% of the population without a classification.
	A2A2: Chromosomes are not what make gender, instead it is the gametes one is disposed to produce. If one produces sperm, they are male. If one produces ova, they are female. There is no speak of chromosomes here, and it accounts for the entire population.

# Psychological Essentialism

#### A woman is someone who has the psychological predisposition to desire to fit the social role of femininity

## Psychological Essentialism
See [[Destiny]]

## A2 Psychological Essentialism

### A2 Psych Essentialism: Collapse into Performativism
Does this not collapse into the gender performativity thesis? Who would perform the social role of femininity if not people who had the desire to do so? 


A2: If someone feels ambivalent about their gender but is assigned female at birth, would their lack of desire make them not a woman?

# Gender Performativism

#### A woman is someone who performs the social role of "femininity"

## Gender Performativism

See [[Butler]], [[De Beauvoir]], [[Foucault]], [[Wittig]]
See [[Becoming]]

"One is not born a woman, but rather becomes one" - [[De Beauvoir]]

"In this sense, *gender* is not a noun... gender is performatively produced and compelled by the regulatory practice of gender coherence.... Gender proves to be performative - that is, constituting the identity it is purported to be. In this sense, gender is always a doing, though not a doing by a subject who might be said to pre-exist teh deed.... (As quoted in the [[On the Genealogy of Morals and Ecce Homo]]), "there is no being behind doing, effecting, becoming; 'the doer' is merely a fiction added to the deed - the deed is everything" [[Gender Trouble]], 33

"Gender is the repeated sylization of the body, a set of repeatd acts within a highly rigid regulatory frame." ([[Gender Trouble]] 43)

## A2 Gender Performativism

### Argument from Absurdity (Transracialism)
If you buy this, you also have to bite the bullet on [[Transracialism]] existing, unless a successful symmetry breaker is found.
	A2A2: [[Tuvel]]: Transracialism is true.

# Gender Oppressionism

#### A woman is someone who is oppressed by the patriarchy

## Gender Oppressionism
 Gender categories are defined in terms of how one is socially positioned (economically, legally, interpersonally), hierarchally in a broader complex of other dominations, and is 'marked' for this oppression based on presumed reproductive freatures.
	 [[Haslanger]], Gender and Race:, 39

## A2 Gender Oppressionism

### Argument Universal Violence of Patriarchy
Are men not also oppressed by the patriarchy? Does the patriarchy not enforce rigid gender roles upon men and make it such that they cannot express emotions properly? Thus, are not *all* people oppressed by the patriarchy, including those that support it?

# Self-Identificationism

#### A woman is someone who identifies as a woman

## Self-Identificationism

## A2 Self-Identificationism

### Circularity Argument
A2: This definition is circular. Lets abstract the general form to create an ad absurdum.
	A {     } is someone who identifies as a {     }.
	A  {{   }} is someone who identifies as a {     }.
	A  {{{ }}} is someone who identifies as a {{     }}.
	OR
	A woman is someone who identifies as a woman
	A woman self identified person is someone who identifies as identifying as a woman
	A woman self identified self identified person is someone who identifies as identifying as identifying as a woman
		Clearly the latter few are absurd, very few people if any identify as identifying as (...) a woman, meaning they are not women by this definition.

### Private Language Argument
The author constructs a [[Private Language]] by creating such a definition, and thus the claim is unverifiable at best ([[Wittgenstein]])

# Gender prescriptivism 

#### A woman is someone who society ought to treat as a woman

## Gender Prescriptivism

## A2 Gender Prescriptivism

### A2 Prescriptivism: This is a Category Mistake
This view is not metaphysical in nature, but moral. Even if we ought to treat someone as a woman for ethical reasons, that does not mean that they actually are a women. These are distinct things.

# Gender Nihilism 
#### Women don't exist; a 'woman' is an absurd concept.

## Gender Nihilism

## A2 Gender Nihilism

### Feminism implies Women
What exactly is feminism without the existence of women? How can one call themself a feminist if they have no understanding of what a woman is?
	"The qualifications for being a subject (of feminism) must be met before representation can be extended" [[Gender Trouble]], 4
