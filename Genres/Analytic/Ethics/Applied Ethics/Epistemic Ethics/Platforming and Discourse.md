## Argument for Democratic Discourse

### Argument from Contradiction
See [[Vogel]]
By making an argument against democratic discourse and platforming, you are engaging in that discourse in itself. 
	"This is the dogmatism of the ventriloquist, who is in truth simply another participant in the discourse but tries to claim a unique authority for her own views over those of other participants by insisting that the views she expresses  derive some special source of extradiscursive truth" [[Thinking like a Mall]], 235
		This is also interestingly linked to the discussion of [[Against Nature (Metaphysics)]], as an appeal to nature would be an appeal to this extradiscursive truth.
			The greatest advantage of such a philosophy is that it gives up the idea that there is something beyond us or above us to whose dictates we must submit unquestioningly, whether that something be God, or Nature." [[Thinking like a Mall]] 238"

### Argument from Social Construction
See [[Vogel]]
Since a moral-legal system is necessarily social, there needs to be social discourse in order to determine such a system. If we live in a socially determined democracy, we need to (socially) reconstruct the social body in order to attain progress
	"The environment around us is always the product of our social practices" [[Thinking like a Mall]], 231
