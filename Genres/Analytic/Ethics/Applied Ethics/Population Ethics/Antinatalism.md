### The Asymmetry Argument 
- Being born happy is good
- Being born sad is bad
- Not being born and avoiding a happy life is neutral
- Not being born and avoiding a sad life is good


### The [[Categorical Imperative]] (Strong Autonomy Argument)
The *only* reason one would bring a child into the world is to fulfill a prudential imperative (to make the parents happy). If someone decides that they want a child because it would make them fulfilled and because they think they can give their kids a good life, this fails the CI. By bringing a child into the world for your sake is using them as a pure means to an end, as they cannot consent to birth. You are abusing their rational potential for your own preference of being a parent.

### Autonomy (Weak Autonomy Argument)
If you took 100 people and put them in a room against their will, and gave 99 of them $100,000, but cut off one persons arms and legs, then it doesn't seem intuitively pleasing such that (despite increasing net utility) this would be an ethical thing to do, simply because nobody signed up for being in the room. The analogous case to antinatalism is that the 99 people are people who love life and its fruits, but one person is in abject pain for their entire life due to something they did not consent to.
