# Replaceability
If I kill a being, while at the same time bringing a being of equal happiness into the world, has any wrong been committed? 

# Nobody is Replaceable
See [[Kant]]
See [[Categorical Imperative]]

### Rights Argument
Because certain beings have certain rights not to be killed, the violation of such rights are bad in-themselves, whether or not more happiness is produces. 

# Some Beings are Replaceable
See [[Singer]], [[Kagan]]

## Animals are Replaceable, Persons are Not
See [[Personhood]]

### Argument from Social Anxiety
If I kill a person, other people will recognize a threat to their lives and be mentally harmed by living in constant fear of their own death for similar reasons. [[Practical Ethics]] 76-80

### Argument from Planning
[[Singer]]
Since people have plans for the future and aspirations later in life, we would be frustrating the preferences of current people by killing them. This makes killing them wrong. [[Practical Ethics]] 80-81
	A2: [[Kagan]] Does the new person not have a desire created (and fulfilled) to be alive? How would the preference utilitarian escape? [[Singer On Killing Animals]], 148
		A2A2: The thing that matters is only that creating fulfilled preferences for actual beings,  not contingent, nonexistent beings.
			A2A2A2: This falls into the same issues as [[Antinatalism]] and Asymmetry [[Pleasure and Pain Asymmetry]]
		A2A2: There are other objective goods besides frustrated or unfrustrated preferences
			A2A2A2: What are they?
			A2A2A2: We can still run with the replacability argument by making it such that the potential child has the same "objective goods" that the victim will have

[[Kagan]]
If a person A's life is made of 4 moments, a he, at t1, prefers to experience pleasure at t1, t2, t3, and t4. At t2, they prefer pleasure at t2, t3, t4; etc etc.
In total, this will lead to 10 satisfied preferences if the person is unkilled and happy.

Now, we should look at the counter factual: how many preferences will exist if someone is killed and replaced at t2?
3 of A's preferences are fulfilled, and 4 are frustrated. 3 never come to be. This creates a preference total of -1 (4-3=-1)
If A is replaced by B at t2, they will have only 7 fulfilled preferences in the same time period. This, added to the -1 utility of person A creates a net utility of +6
Thus, the total net utility of satisfied preferences is still only 6, compared to the 10 where there is no replacement
~~~
Outcome 1: t1 -------- t2 -------- t3  -------- t4
	Total: +10
Outcome 2: t1 -------- t2//  //t2 -------- t3  -------- t4
	Total: +6
~~~
In the end, there is more utility when not replacing person A (10>7). 
[[Singer On Killing Animals]], 150
	A2: This may be true within the framework of t1-t4, but this fails to consider that person B will have a t5 and t6, which, in the end, calculates *more* net utility in outcome 2 than outcome 1.

### Argument from Rights
#### Preference Util
A right to life is created by the desire to continue living in the future. Mere animals lack this fucntion and will thus not get this right to life available to people. [[Practical Ethics]] 81-83. 
A person heavily values their autonomy as a rational agent, and frustrating that autonomy by killing them will frustrate the preference for self determination, creating a harm only accessible to persons. [[Practical Ethics]] 83-84

#### Deontology



## Everybody is Replaceable
See [[Epicurus]]
