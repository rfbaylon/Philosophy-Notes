| Actual    | 1. Currently existing (An alive human)          | 2. Beings that will exist due to a particular choice (A couple's to-be child)                                   |
| Potential | 3. Future humans (Population 10 years from now) | 4. Beings that could have existed, but never do (A child any couple could make but dont care to think about it) |
Narrow views focus on the inevitable, broader views focus on all quadrants.

- The Total View cares about quadrants 1, 2, 3, 4
- The Prior Existence View cares about quadrants 1, 3
- The Actualist View cares about quadrants 1, 2, 3

# Total View
The only thing that matters is the net utility of the world at any point.
Toby [[Ord]], [[Nagel]], [[Singer]], [[Kagan]]
See [[Prudence]], [[The Possibility of Altruism]], [[Altruism]]

A2: Under the Total View, we are obligated to create beings that have happy lives, whether or not we want it.


# Prior Existence View
## AKA Person Affecting View
See [[Narveson]]
See 

Only people living deserve moral consideration
	"we are in the buisness of making people happy, not making happy people" - Jan [[Narveson]]
	Look into "Asymmetry Intuition in population ethics" Making a baby and bringing it into a hellish world would be immoral, but would this mean we are morally obligated to bring a baby into a good world?
		A2: How can we care about climate change if we dont care about future people?
		A2: How can the asymmetry intuition make sense in the first place??
		A2: Under this view, it would not be wrong to bring an abjectly miserable child into the world, but it would be morally obligatory to euthanize it. Does this not seem paradoxical? [[Practical Ethics]], 89
		A2: [[Kagan]]: Prior Existence leads to paradoxes
			Outcome 1: Person A is decently happy
			Outcome 2: Person A is slightly more happy than Outcome 1, but Person B will live a miserable life. 
			If outcome 2, then both A and B are actual, in which case outcome 1 would be better overall. But if Outcome 1, then only A is actual, so B's interests are irrelevant. Since B's interests are irrelevant, we ought to choose what is best for A, which would be Outcome 2
			Thus, neither choice is acceptable!

# Actualist View

Only beings that are actual ought to be considered
	A2: [[Kagan]]: Actualism leads to paradoxes
		Outcome 1: Person A is decently happy
		Outcome 2: Person A is slightly more happy than Outcome 1, but Person B will live a miserable life. 
		If outcome 2, then both A and B are actual, in which case outcome 1 would be better overall. But if Outcome 1, then only A is actual, so B's interests are irrelevant. Since B's interests are irrelevant, we ought to choose what is best for A, which would be Outcome 2
		Thus, neither choice is acceptable!
