# Potentiality
A fetus is valuable in-itself when it has the potentiality for intrinsic value
**Before Conception**
See [[Marquis]], Modal Position in [[What's Wrong With Death]]
	A2: [[Singer]]: "To pull out a sprouting acorn is not the same as cutting down a venerable oak. To drop a fertile egg into boiling water is very different from doing the same to a live chicken... Prince Charles (had) the potential to be the king of England, but he (didn't) have the rights of a king.." [[Practical Ethics]], 138
	A2: [[Singer]]: If a woman is pregnant, but aborts the baby (at, say, 8 months) in order to better family plan for a baby she wants to instead have 2 years from then, there is thus no wrong. Either way, a potential human is killed and one is born. [[Practical Ethics]], 139
	A2: Breaking DaVinci's paintbrush is not the same as breaking the Mona Lisa.
	A2: Is deciding not to have a child the same as killing a 5 year old? Is it worse?

# Conception 
A fetus is valuable in-itself when the sperm fertilizes the egg
**5-7 Days**
	A2: How does this apply to totipotent embryos (embryos that split into 2) By taking Plan B after a totipotent egg is fertilized, do you kill one or two beings? There is no continuity of existence for these beings, we cant reasonably say that a fertilized egg is "you" if you're a twin.
	A2: IVF (In Vitro Fertilization) is a process by which ova are removed from a woman, placed in a peri dish, and fertilized with sperm. These conceived beings will *not* grow into children unless placed in utero. This creates two lead bullets the connectionist must bite:
		1. If someone were to accidentally fertilize an egg without realizing a donor couldn't make it for their appointment and couldn't freeze it, they just killed a full human being.
		2. The existence of these facilities creates one of largest moral failing in the history of the world. By creating *so many* fertilized eggs and freezing them, with many of them expiring or failing, IVF facilities kill millions of people every year. If one were truly pro-life, these labs would be the first place to protest, not abortion centers.
	A2: Why does fertilization create personhood? Does this belief not just collapse into the potentiality argument above?

# Heartbeat
A fetus is valuable in-itself when it develops a heartbeat
**~5-6 Weeks**

# Quickening
A fetus is valuable in-itself when the mother feels movement in the womb
**~16-20 Weeks**
[[Catholicism]] states that as soion as the mother feels the baby moving in the womb, it gains its soul.
	A2: Fetuses move long before the mother can feel it move (Fetuses move at roughly 6 weeks as opposed to the mother feeling it for the first time at 16-20 weeks)
	A2: Does the capacity for physical motion necessarily carry moral weight? 
	A2: Catholic doctrine needs to be proven in order to move forward with this argument

# Viability
A fetus is valuable in-itself when it can survive outside of the womb
**~24 Weeks**
Independence upon the mother is what draws the line.
- This is where *Roe v Wade* drew the line
	A2: The point at which the fetus can survive outside of the womb is entirely dependent on the medical technology of the time and place. This not only means that fetuses were intrinsically less valuable based on external factors, but it means that places without good medical technology have less valuable fetuses. 
		Suppose a woman pregnant in New York flew to New Guinea. A baby that would be considered valuable in NY would now have no intrinsic value. (example from [[Practical Ethics]], 127)
		"Until modern methods of intensive care, a 2 month premature baby could not survive. Now a three month premature baby can pull through." ([[Practical Ethics]], 127)
	A2: An elderly person could be dependent on her daughter, an injured hiker could be dependent on her friend. That doesnt mean these people dont have intrinsic worth.
	A2: The baby is dependent upon the mother for years upon years *after* it is born. Does this dependency deprive its intrinsic worth? Is it OK to kill a 5 year old for example?

# Sentience
A fetus is valuable in-itself when it has desires
**~18-30 Weeks** #WIP 
See [[When do fetuses feel pain]], [[Practical Ethics]] 136
	A2: a bullet that needs to be bit with this view is that babies are worth significantly less than adult humans, or even nonhuman animals like dogs or pigs. If one were to see a bunch of rats eating a baby alive, one ought to have the same reaction to a bunch of rats eating a baby alive. Babies are also not rewarded the same privileges of people (See [[Personhood]]; [[Genres/Analytic/Ethics/Applied Ethics/Environmental Ethics/Veganism/Sentience Hierarchies]] for more information). 

# Birth
A fetus is valuable in-itself when it exits the birth canal
**~9 Months**
	A2: The baby is still the same being, the same subject whether or not it is in the womb. The location of the child is irrelevant to its intrinsic moral worth.
