The evidence shows that the neural circuitry necessary to distinguish touch from painful touch does not, in fact, develop until late in the third trimester. The occurrence of intrauterine fetal movement is not an indication that a fetus can feel pain.
  

JAMA: The authors defined pain as the awareness of noxious stimuli

DIGRESSION : Using this definition, [[do plants feel pain]]?
  
Gate theory of pain says pain still happens

“Yet, in the neonate and fetus they seem to perform that additional function,” Dr. Anand said. “The structures and mechanisms used for pain processing in early life are unique to each stage of development. One cannot say that because the structures used for pain perception in adults are underdeveloped in the fetus, pain perception is not present.”In addition, the perception of pain requires more than the participation of the somatosensory cortex in the brain, Dr. Anand contends….The authors of the JAMA article, he said, ignore the fact that pain processing also occurs at the thalamic level. He noted that in their survey of the literature, the authors did not include articles that make such a claim.

Pain is different from [nociception](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/nociception) because pain is primarily a subjective experience of discomfort, despair and other negative affective states (e.g. see [Allen, Fuchs, Shriver, & Wilson, 2005](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347216300513#bib6)). In humans it is possible to have nociception without pain, and pain without any activity in nociceptive fibres ([Hardcastle, 1997](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347216300513#bib24)). For example, after ingesting morphine people can still sense pain, but do so without a sense of suffering or producing characteristic pain behaviours (e.g. wincing) ([Hardcastle, 1997](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347216300513#bib24)).

----> Thus, because of the hard problem of consciousness, it is impossible to know if insects feel pain

  

In essence, robots and computer simulations demonstrate how pain-like behaviour can be produced without the subjective experience of pain.
