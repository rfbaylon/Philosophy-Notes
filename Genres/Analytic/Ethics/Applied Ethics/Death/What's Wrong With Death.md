## Epicurean Position on Death
See [[Epicurus]], [[Singer]] (only regarding beings without [[Personhood]])
Killing is not bad for the person who is being killed, as there is no agent there to feel the badness of the killing.

Killing is bad IFF
	1. It is painful as the killing is happening (e.g., the pain of a knife piercing the skin before reaching the vital organs)
	2. other people (family, friends) are negatively affected by the killing (e.g., the pain of mourning a lost family member)
	3.  The killing creates fear for the general population (e.g., a raging lunatic is on the loose and could harm me or the people I love)
	Thus, [[Epicurus]] has to bite the bullet that secretly and painlessly killing a person with no attachments to this world would not be immoral.

### [[Lucretius]]' Argument from Pre-Natal Symmetry
It wasn't bad for us that we weren't around to see the pyramids when they were built, or that we could not have met Plato in ancient Greece. Just as it wasn't bad for us to be not alive *before* we were born, it will not be bad for us to be not alive after we die. There is a perfect symmetry here.
	"What loss were ours, if we had know not birth?  
	Let living me to longer life aspire,  
	While fond affection binds their hearts to earth  
	But who never hath tasted life's desire,  
	Unborn, impersonal, can feel no dearth."

### Bullets to Bite
- Replacability of humans: If i kill someone and then bring an equally happy child into the world, this would be a neutral thing. 

## Modal Position on Death
See [[Nagel]], [[Ord]]
Killing a being is bad in so far as you remove future pleasure that person would have experienced if they were alive.

### Bullets to Bite
- Choosing not to have a kid (when it would be happy to be alive) is the same as murdering a kid
- As someone gets older, murdering them is less wrong

## Preferential Position on Death
See [[Singer]] regarding [[Personhood]]
Killing a being with future plans and preferences that are not death (Persons) would be immoral as you are frustrating their future preferences. For nonpersons, Singer takes the Epicurean view.

## Sanctity of Life
See [[Jainism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Kant]]
