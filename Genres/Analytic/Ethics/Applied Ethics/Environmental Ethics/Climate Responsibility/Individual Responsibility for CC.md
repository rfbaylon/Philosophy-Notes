# Do wealthy individuals have blame and/or responsibility to reduce emissions?
## AKA The Problem of Inconsequentialism


# Tragedy of the Commons


## Yes

### Virtue Ethical Argument
See [[Sandler]]
If someone burns a bunch of fossil fuels for fun, even if it doesnt contrubte to any disutility, it still degrades the individuals character. There *is* something wrong with being the kind of person who burns way too many fossil fuels, not with burning fossil fuels.
	A2: This argument is circular as a 'virtue' in [[Sandler]]'s sense is defined in relation to a vice, and visa versa. [[Vogel]] argues that Sandler defines these terms as an appeal to intuition. In other words, what is actually bad about being the person that does burn FFs? 

## No
See [[Vogel]]

A person will not be morally responsible for their carbon emissions, but a collection of individuals (individual qua citizen) can be. The collective is responsible for good land use, not the individual

#### Presuppositions
If someone dies or completely eliminates their carbon foot print, this will do near nothing for the climate disaster. The climate crisis will still affect all the individuals the same either way

### Consequentialist Argument
See [[Sinnott-Armstrong]], [[Vogel]]
Since there is no benefit or utility being created if I personally stop contributing to Global Warming, there is no reason to stop consuming the amount that I do. Any individual action wont have any effect. 
	"If a public bridge becomes unsafe because of overuse by traffic, the government has an obligation to fix it, but that doesnt mean that I as a citizen have an obligation  to go out and fix it" [[Thinking like a Mall]], 210
	A2: If I reduce my CO2, I act as a model for others to do the same. Thus, my impact is not only me.
		A2A2: Has it been emprically borne out that people actually follow suit when a neighbor stops driving a car? How much impact is there really? [[Thinking like a Mall]], 21

In positive terms, even if we dont have an individual obligation to not burn fossil fuels, we do have an obligation to build the sort of community that restricts or abolishes fossil fuel use. 

### Bean Bandits Analogy
If a  hungry bandit rolls into a starving village and secretly steals one bean from each person (assuming each person in the village has 100 beans) in order to feed himself, there seems to be no harm done. Nobody would care or notice if one bean were gone, so they are nor harmed, and the bandit gets to eat aswell. The bandit clearly did nothing wrong [[Thinking like a Mall]], 215
