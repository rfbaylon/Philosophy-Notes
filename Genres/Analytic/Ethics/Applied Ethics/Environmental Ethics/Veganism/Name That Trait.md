## Formulations of Name The Trait
- What is true of animals that, if true of humans, would make it morally permissible to torture, kill, and eat them.

## The Trait is...

### Personhood
See [[Personhood]]

### Modal Personhood
See [[Kagan]]
If something is a person (Going by [[Kagan]] and [[Singer]]'s definition in [[Personhood]]) or metaphysically could have been a person, it is granted more moral worth than a nonperson. A modal person can only be said to exist if they are a part of a *person species.* This runs contra [[Singer]] who claims that intensity and duration of pain are the only factors that matter.
- Note that this argument does not mean nonhuman animals have *no* value, just less
	A2: What exactly is a person species? At what point does a "species" become a "person species"? when more than 50% of a species is a person?
		A2A2: [[Kagan]] nononono, its when the generic member of a species is a person [[What's Wrong With Speciesism]], 14
			A2A2A2: That is still an appeal to statistics.
	A2: Why even stop at species? Why not a genus? Phylum? Or even more out there, why not part of the set-of-things-that-X? For example, would a philosophy club honorarily making their pet rabbit make it part of a "person group?"
		A2A2: Those are artificial groups. What matters is natural groups. [[What's Wrong With Speciesism]], 14
			A2A2A2: how do you make a meaningful distinction between a natural and unnatural grouping? [[Wittgenstein]] would hate this argument.
	A2: Why draw the line at *metaphysical* modality and not logical modality? Or Biological modality? What exactly do you mean by *could have been*?
	A2: Even then, there is a metaphysically possible world by which rabbits could be persons.
	A2: The argument implies someone could be the same person with entirely different genes. This is an incredibly (at best) controversial claim in the study of identity.
