## Nature A vs Nature B
Nature A
	“all the powers existing in either the outer or the inner world and everything which takes place by means of those powers” ([[J.S. Mill; A Selection of His Works]], 431).
	as opposed to Supernatural

Nature B
	“without the… agency of man" ([[J.S. Mill; A Selection of His Works]], 431).
	as opposed to artificial

# Against Nature
See [[Spinoza]], [[Whitehead]], [[Vogel]], [[Marris]], [[J.S. Mill]], [[Zizek]], [[Sidgwick]]

## [[Sandler]]'s Proof
1.  In any definition of nature, either humans are a part of nature (A) or not (B).
2.  If (A), then everything humans do is natural.
3.  If (B), then everything humans do is unnatural.
4.  The point of ethics is to distinguish between actions of agents, marking them either morally good, bad, or neutral.
5.  If (4), then every agent-driven action cannot necessarily be good or bad.
6.  ∴, the concept of naturalness is not useful in ethics.

## [[J.S. Mill]]'s Consequences
Nature doesn't seem like the best moral blueprint. If the person claiming Nature is a valubale category in itself, then they have to bite the bullet that the following paragraph is filled with virtue.
	"Nature impales men, breaks them as if on the wheel, casts them to be devoured by wild beasts, burns them to death, crushes them with stones like the first Christian martyr, starves them with hunger, freezes them with cold, poisons them by the quick or slow venom of her exhalations, and has hundreds of other hideous deaths in reserve, such as the ingenious cruelty of a Nabis or a Domitian never surpassed. All this Nature does with the most supercilious disregard both of mercy and of justice, emptying her shafts upon the best and noblest indifferently with the meanest and worst; upon those who are engaged in the highest and worthiest enterprises, and often as the direct consequence of the noblest acts; and it might almost be imagined as a punishment for them."

## [[Zizek]]'s Anti-Essentialist Argument

Historically, the biggest arguments against equality have come from what is natural. Women are naturally subservient; black people are naturally inferior due to an indent in their brains; homosexuality is unnatural; humans naturally have canine teeth and eat nonhuman animal products; transitioning ones gender is unnatural; capitalism is part of human nature; the state naturally forms, humans naturally yearn for authority. Implied in all of these arguments is the hidden conclusion that we ought to do that which is natural. The inherent construction of normative claims of nature (here, also defined as [[Essentialism]]) has been the principal cause of incredible amounts of suffering of humans, and its validation by ethicists has had wholly reactionary effects. Any preservationist or environmental philosopher who touts the value of ‘nature’ must drag with them the reactionary impulse to call anything outside of the status quo ‘unnatural’ and thus bad.
	We understand the naturalistic [[Fallacy]], we just dont believe it as a product of [[ideology]]. Nature here is the object of fetishization. 

Another issue with [[Essentialism]] and naturalist arguments isn't that bigots understand human nature wrong, but rather that the ‘naturalness’ they claim exists in certain traits or behaviors never existed in the first place.

	“When nature is used as a standard, the danger always is that what we think we have learned from nature may really be what we ourselves have already presupposed, and the standard we claim to find there is merely an expression of our own social context and our own social prejudices claiming for themselves the authority of the “natural” and therefore not to be questioned” #Quote
