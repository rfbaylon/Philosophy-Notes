Considerations

### Which relations give rise to special obligations?
Relations of Suffering management (Humans have an obligation)
Relations of causal responsibility for suffering and effective management (Humans dont have an obligation)
Relations of nonwildness (Humans dont have an obligation)
Relations of species typical forms of life (Humans dont have an obligation)

# Humans dont have an Obligation

This section contains arguments either claiming that helping animals in the wild is either morally neutral *or* morally wrong. 

The proponent of this view needs to find some other values besides welfare to appeal to. Popular views include:
- Wildness
- Naturalness
- Causal Responsibility ([[Palmer]])


## Humans don't have an Obligation
See [[Palmer]], 

### Contextual View
See [[Palmer]]
The suffering of others is only our responsibility so far as I cause it. If I create a causal barrier to a wild animal such that it cannot properly flourish, I owe it some sort of retribution. Thus, this view captures the important parts of the 'contingent consequentialist' view (not abject disregard for nonhuman animals) while not taking on the more unfavorable consequences (turning the wild into a zoo).
	A2: After climate change, there is no 'wilderness' any more. Everything in the world is causally related to human beings. Does this mean that we actually have the same practical outcome as the contingent consequentialist?
		A2A2: Not necessarily: Just because something humans have done to nonhumans impacts them in some way, it doesn't mean that we made their life worse off. By dipping our toes into a pond, that does not make us responsible for everything in the pond. 
		A2A2: The perspectival view: that we might have modified the macro environment, but animals would be suffering otherwise, non-identity problem, and so that alone is not sufficient to establish the responsibility. It must also be that the particular sort of causal impacts function as constraints on animals in the right sort of way (frustrating species-typical behavior? Something else?)


### Argument from Causal Relation
See [[Palmer]]

We have an obligation to help wild animals insofar as humans are responsible for them. This is measured by current dependency and strength of cause.

#### Pets
Humans both create and form dependent relations with pets, leading to more responsibility
	This connects well with obligations to children from parenthood

Thus, "It seems reasonable to argue that where humans, as individuals, assume roles of material provision for particular urban animals that lead to dependence, humans should accept, as individuals, ethical responsibility for those actions" Placing Animals in Urban Environmental Ethics 2003, 70

#### Wild Urban Animals
Humans have causal responsibility for urban wild animals existing where they are (otherwise they would not be urban)

But it doesnt seem obvious that we have direct moral duties, thus the only thing we owe urban wild animals is wildlife corridors, considerate architecture, and proper city planning 

#### Opportunistic Urban Animals
Opportunistic animals choose to follow humans to settlements, and eat scraps. They initiated contact with humans

Thus, it seems prima facie true that we have no special positive obligations to protect them

#### Feral Urban Animals
There are *way* too many possible cases that need to be considered. Needs to be determined on a case by case basis.

### Modifying wild animals violates their integrity
Integrity is “the wholeness and intactness of the animal and its species-specific balance, as well as the capacity to sustain itself in an environment suitable to the species” (Rutgers and Heeger, 1999).
Integrity is the species typical norm, "The cowness of a cow." Straying from this ideal for aesthetic or econimic reasons seems to be wrong. 
	Why do we take this image of the animal as the ideal? Would this argument not collapse into the argument from tampering with an animals nature? ([[Bovenkerk]], 2020)

### Modifying wild animals instrumentalizes them
Two general meanings of instrumentalization can be distinguished: it can either mean treating an animal as an object or actually turning an animal partly into an object (Brom, 1997).
Objectifying an animal is wrong insofar as it denies its interests, autonomy, or nature. Similar values to the [[Virtue Ethics]] approach. By only focuing on animals as tools to function in some larger machine designed against them, it "de-animalizes" them.
	A2: It seems possible to engage in genetic modification of animals such that it specifically benefits them. If it is their own good we are both striving for, where does the 'mere use' come from? 

### Modifying Wild Animals Amounts to Playing God
Playing God is wrong because as we begin to control more and more things with more and more power, it has historically lead to poor outcomes for the problems we attempt to solve. Mary Shelly's Frankenstein deals with this motif, but more philosophically [[Foucault]] or [[Scott]] could use this argument. 

### Modifying Wild Animals is Unnatural
See [[On Nature (Ethics)]], [[Nature (Metaphysics)]]
By invoking the unnaturalness-objection in this context, critics mean that by adapting animals, we are doing something which is artificial and/or we are turning the animal into an artifact. The argument is therefore related to the instrumentalization objection as discussed earlier. ([[Bovenkerk]], 2020)
