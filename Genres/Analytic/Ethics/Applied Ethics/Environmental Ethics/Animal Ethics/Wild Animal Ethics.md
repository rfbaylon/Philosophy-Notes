Considerations

### Which relations give rise to special obligations?
Relations of Suffering management (Humans have an obligation)
Relations of causal responsibility for suffering and effective management (Humans dont have an obligation)
Relations of nonwildness (Humans dont have an obligation)
Relations of species typical forms of life (Humans dont have an obligation)

The dilemma: How do we parse the morality of these statements in a nonspeciesist way?
(A) A human hunter attacks a deer
(B) A mountain lion attacks a deer
(C) A mountain lion attacks a human child

# Interventionism

## Strong Interventionism
See [[Horta]], [[Nussbaum]]
See [[Utilitarianism]]

### The Capabilities Approach
See [[Nussbaum]]
See [[Justice for Animals]]
There is a certain set of capabilities that all sentient beings ought to have the option pursue if they so choose.
	A2: Using the CA, we either have to go back to the experience machine for all nonhuman animals that made [[Horta]]s view untenable or eliminate biodiversity in favor of having like 5 species in hyper controlled zoos. Either horn of this will eliminate the 'wonder' that grounded her view in the first place, making the position self defeating. 

## A2 Strong Interventionism

### Wild Animal Welfare is Intractable
See [[Palmer]]
Trying to fix one area in the wild will cause another area to blow up. By taking care of whooping cranes, you cause immense suffering of the prey animals that the cranes eat. By not taking care of whooping cranes, you bolster the prey species which causes them to over populate resulting more R strategist lives not worth living and fiercer competition for the prey species, potentially destroying the ecosystem as a whole. (Assisting Wild Animals Vulnerable to Climate Change, 187)

## Weak Interventionism

### [[Swart]]'s Care Ethical Approach
Although [[Swart]] likes where [[Callicott]] and Wenz were thinking, both theories have terminal flaws. Instead of making an ethic around community first and foremost, he wants to make a theory that relies on relationships, not dissimilar from [[Palmer]]'s approach. 
The way it is dissimilar though is that [[Swart]] wants to create an approach that creates special role based obligations (such as taking care of pets) BUT he also thinks that the existence of special obligations does not deny the existence of general oblgations for wild animals. There is also a place for specific care for beings that wont fuck up the ecosystem if alive.

### Wild Sovereignty
See [[Donaldson]] & [[Kymlicka]]
Make notes! #WIP 
	A2: [[Horta]]: Animals can seldom respond to their challenges, negating the first condition of sovereignty. Firstly, as a proxy for the competence of wild animals, the authors cite the thriving of populations -- this is a horrible evaluation when considering the pain of *individuals*. 
	A2: [[Horta]]: In defending sovereignty as an ethical principle, the authors take it to be good in itself, citng colonialism or invasions as evidence. This is a decieving comparison, as humanitarian efforts might be OK (let alone appreciated!) by the nations, even if by force. Not only that, but they contradict themselves when talking about domestic animals -- self determination is not good in itself for them!
		A2A2: This is incredible hubris -- [[J.S. Mill]] assumed colonialism was a humanitarian effort, Hitler assumed his invasion of Poland was a humanitarian effort.
		A2A2: Domesticated animals are the kinds of beings that do not care about self determination, *precisely because they are domesticated*. They are akin to [[Aristotle]]an Natural Slaves. 
	A2: [[Horta]] Even if it is the case that sovereignty does not require law or leaders, it does require being a part of a communuty, which importantly means there are common aims or collaboration. Wild animals do NOT do that. Competition for your life kind of removes that 'collaboration' aspect
	
	

## A2 Weak Interventionism

# Noninterventionism

There are no positive obligations to aid wild animals, though it would not be wrong to.

### Contextual View
See [[Palmer]]
The suffering of others is only our responsibility so far as I cause it. If I create a causal barrier to a wild animal such that it cannot properly flourish, I owe it some sort of retribution. Thus, this view captures the important parts of the 'contingent consequentialist' view (not abject disregard for nonhuman animals) while not taking on the more unfavorable consequences (turning the wild into a zoo).
	A2: After climate change, there is no 'wilderness' any more. Everything in the world is causally related to human beings. Does this mean that we actually have the same practical outcome as the contingent consequentialist?
		A2A2: Not necessarily: Just because something humans have done to nonhumans impacts them in some way, it doesn't mean that we made their life worse off. By dipping our toes into a pond, that does not make us responsible for everything in the pond. 
		A2A2: The perspectival view: that we might have modified the macro environment, but animals would be suffering otherwise, non-identity problem, and so that alone is not sufficient to establish the responsibility. It must also be that the particular sort of causal impacts function as constraints on animals in the right sort of way (frustrating species-typical behavior? Something else?)
	A2: If it is the case that "morally relevant entanglements" are what ground our duties towards nonhumans, would it also not be the case that there are humans that we are not in morally relevant entanglements with? For example, I have no causal influence on [[Global Poverty]], but it might still seem like I have some sort of obligation to donate to relief efforts. Further, [[Palmer]] would have to bite the bullet on passing the drowning child in [[Singer]]'s thought experiment. (Disentangling Obligations of Assistance, 212)
	A2: This can be clearly observed in the following scenario. Suppose that you are presented with these choices: 
	(i) press button A: all human beings are immunized against all lethal forms of cancer; 
	(ii) press button B: only those human beings with whom we are engaged in “morally-relevant entanglements” are so immunized; 
	(iii) press no button. 
	Palmer’s view would imply that we are morally required to press B, while we may permissibly choose not to press A. ((Disentangling Obligations of Assistance, 216)


#### Pets
Humans both create and form dependent relations with pets, leading to more responsibility
	This connects well with obligations to children from parenthood

Thus, "It seems reasonable to argue that where humans, as individuals, assume roles of material provision for particular urban animals that lead to dependence, humans should accept, as individuals, ethical responsibility for those actions" Placing Animals in Urban Environmental Ethics 2003, 70

#### Wild Urban Animals
Humans have causal responsibility for urban wild animals existing where they are (otherwise they would not be urban)

But it doesnt seem obvious that we have direct moral duties, thus the only thing we owe urban wild animals is wildlife corridors, considerate architecture, and proper city planning 

#### Opportunistic Urban Animals
Opportunistic animals choose to follow humans to settlements, and eat scraps. They initiated contact with humans

Thus, it seems prima facie true that we have no special positive obligations to protect them

#### Feral Urban Animals
There are *way* too many possible cases that need to be considered. Needs to be determined on a case by case basis. 

### Argument from Climate Justice
See [[Pepper]]
See [[Name That Trait]]
As humans cause rights violations to animals by bolstering climate change, they are then owed aid as a matter of justice. Just like rights to health, food, and life are pivotal in fully capturing how we ought to adapt to climate change for humans, similar rights ought to be captured for nonhumans. 
~~~
The GDA: The relevant moral agents have a duty to facilitate adaptation when ever rights to life, health, and subsistence are violated or threatened by anthropogenic climate change.
~~~

This includes making human adaptations suitable for animal health, facilitating adaptation through genetic engineering or assisted migration, and increasing nonhuman access to differing environments.

### The Concentric Circle
See [[Callicott]], Wenz
As things become closer to an individual, the individual has stronger reasons to care. Family is the circle in the middle, and the farthest circle is wild animals and natural processes. What respecting the outermost circle looks like is to simply either bolster or let be the ecological processes that occur. In other words, for [[Callicott]], we ought to be individualists for those close to us and holists for those far from us. (See [[Individualism Vs. Holism]])
For Wenz' model, negative rights (rights to not be harmed, eg) are not affected by proximity. He also argues, pace [[Callicott]], that the evolutionary process ought to be protected, creating value for all sentiant creatures. 
	A2: [[Swart]]: Any community based system ignores the supposition that moral behavior relies on reflection and reason. Who is included in the community? Why?
	A2: [[Swart]]: There is no way to decide which values (larger outer circle, lesser inner circle) ought to prevail. Additional criteria will be necessary to do so. 
	A2: [[Swart]]: Wenz' argument is, ironically, circular. Wenz defines proximity in terms of the obligations one has to others, and obligations in terms of proximity. Of course these things are tied!
	A2: [[Swart]]: Wenz does not care about the evolutionary process, he cares about the individuals - why even make an appeal to evolution as a good (which empirically may also be false) when its not terminal?
	A2: [[Swart]]: Both of these theores are incredibly anthropocentric.

### [[Regan]]'s Rights View
Each sentient being is a subject of a life, meaning that they have intrinsic inviolable rights. Because wild animals are not agents, and thus cannot violate rights, there is no injustice that occurs in the wild outside of what humans do to it. Predation may be tragic, but it is not unjust.
	A2: [[Callicott]], Everett: This view does far too little to account for the moral sphere. There would be no moral duty to protect a puppy from the abuse of a playful toddler, not, the child from the dog. If you do claim that there is a duty for assistance to protect the child from the dog, then it also follows that there is a duty of assistance to protect the wild squirrel from the dog. (Environmental Ethics, Animal Welfarism, and the Problem of Predation, 51)


### Argument from value of species
See [[Sunstein]]
Humans care a lot about being able to view a wide variety of animals, meaning that protecting biodiverity is probably important in some sense.

### Seeing Predation as a Tragedy Denies Nature
Argument reconstructed from *Environmental Ethics, Animal Welfarism, and the Problem of Predation*
1. "Affirming the value of what was crucial to our evolutionary history is necessary for a properly environmental appreciation of nature. 
2. Since predation was crucial to our evolutionary history, one cannot have a properly environmental appreciation of nature unless one affirm the value of predation. 
3. Finding the suffering occasioned by predation regrettable constitutes failing to affirm the value of predation. 
4. Animal welfarists are committed by their principles to regretting the suffering occasioned by predation. 
5. C. Therefore, animal welfarist principles rule out a properly environ mental appreciation of nature."
	A2: Everett: At the very least, the principle on which Hettinger is relying needs to be qualified: If X is an essential part of the process by which Y comes to be what it is, then in order to value Y, we need to value X insofar as it contributes to Y’s being what it is. But it does not follow that we need to value X wholesale, or in every respect 
	"Israel would not exist without the Holocaust, so therefore a proper valuation of Israel would include cherishing the value of the Holocaust"
		(Environmental Ethics, Animal Welfarism, and the Problem of Predation, 58)

### Modifying wild animals violates their integrity
Integrity is “the wholeness and intactness of the animal and its species-specific balance, as well as the capacity to sustain itself in an environment suitable to the species” (Rutgers and Heeger, 1999).
Integrity is the species typical norm, "The cowness of a cow." Straying from this ideal for aesthetic or econimic reasons seems to be wrong. 
	Why do we take this image of the animal as the ideal? Would this argument not collapse into the argument from tampering with an animals nature? ([[Bovenkerk]], 2020)

### Modifying wild animals instrumentalizes them
Two general meanings of instrumentalization can be distinguished: it can either mean treating an animal as an object or actually turning an animal partly into an object (Brom, 1997).
Objectifying an animal is wrong insofar as it denies its interests, autonomy, or nature. Similar values to the [[Virtue Ethics]] approach. By only focusing on animals as tools to function in some larger machine designed against them, it "de-animalizes" them.
	A2: It seems possible to engage in genetic modification of animals such that it specifically benefits them. If it is their own good we are both striving for, where does the 'mere use' come from? 

### Modifying Wild Animals Amounts to Playing God
Playing God is wrong because as we begin to control more and more things with more and more power, it has historically lead to poor outcomes for the problems we attempt to solve. Mary Shelly's Frankenstein deals with this motif, but more philosophically [[Foucault]] or [[Scott]] could use this argument. 

### Modifying Wild Animals is Unnatural
See [[On Nature (Ethics)]], [[Nature (Metaphysics)]]
By invoking the unnaturalness-objection in this context, critics mean that by adapting animals, we are doing something which is artificial and/or we are turning the animal into an artifact. The argument is therefore related to the instrumentalization objection as discussed earlier. ([[Bovenkerk]], 2020)
