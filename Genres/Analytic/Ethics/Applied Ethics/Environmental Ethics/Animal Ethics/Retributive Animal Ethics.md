What do we owe nonhuman animals that have been harmed by human action?

Research Animals

Chimps

By US law, retired research chimps may only be moved to federally funded chiump sanctuaries. At time of writing, there is only one (Chimp Haven)

*Chimp Haven has capacity for a total of 230 animals, and as of 1 January, is home to 225 chimps. But the NIH still has 288 chimps in labs.*

*It costs about $24,000 per chimpanzee annually to provide care at sanctuary. This includes their food, medical care, enrichment and all of the basic necessities for these extraordinary individuals.*

*Chimp Haven is a private, nonprofit organization that depends significantly on the generosity of individuals to help cover the cost of chimpanzee care. Chimp Haven receives government funding (75 percent) to support the care of federally-owned chimpanzees, and must raise the remaining 25 percent of funds for the chimpanzees’ care through private support.*

*"If you look at the medical summaries for some of the chimps, a lot of them will say, 'Well, we're concerned that there'll be a sudden heart attack if the chimps are moved,'" says [Kathleen Conlee](https://www.humanesociety.org/news/animal-researcher-animal-advocate), vice president of animal research issues at the Humane Society of the United States. "Chimpanzees are notorious for cardiac problems anyway. You could be a completely healthy chimpanzee at 16 years old and die from a heart attack, quite frankly. So to us, that's not a reason to keep them sitting in the labs."*

*The cost for the NIH to support a chimp's care at Chimp Haven is significantly cheaper than at research facilities, Conlee points out, as the sanctuary is required to raise some of its own funds. The average [cost](https://orip.nih.gov/comparative-medicine/programs/vertebrate-models/chimpanzee-management-reports) to the NIH is around $26 per animal per day at the sanctuary, compared with around $97 or $124 per day at a research facility.*

*A U.S. federal judge has ruled against the nation’s largest biomedical agency in a long-running battle over the fate of dozens of former research chimpanzees. On Tuesday, a Maryland court declared that the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) violated federal law by not moving the animals out of biomedical facilities to a government sanctuary. The ruling could force the agency to transfer the great apes, though the details remain to be worked out.*

	Follows from the letter of the law layer out in the CHIMP act (thats actually what its called)
	*[CHIMP] also mandated the retirement of NIH-owned chimps no longer needed in biomedical research: “All surplus chimpanzees owned by the Federal Government shall be accepted into the sanctuary system.”*
