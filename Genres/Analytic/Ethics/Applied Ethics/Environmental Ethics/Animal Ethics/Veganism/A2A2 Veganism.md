### Lions eat meat, why can't I?
Just because other nonhuman animals do something doesnt mean that it is good. This is a classic Naturalistic [[Fallacy]]
	I can't imagine seriously walking into a courtroom to defend yourself from charges of being a rapist, for example, with this logic. “Your honor, lions rape eachother, so why can't I? Are you going to stop lions from raping eachother?”
	No. Nobody should base their moral system based off of what literary wild animals do. We are humans and we have the capability to rationalize and make moral decisions, unlike lions. 

  

### Eating meat is a personal choice. Live and let live.
Live and let live only works if you live and let live. Choosing chocolate ice cream over vanilla is a personal choice, but abusing an animal for your own benefit isn't your own whimsical personal choice. The animal you're eating is forced against their will to be on your plate, so it's not just your will we have to take into consideration.
Continuing, “Abusing my dog is my personal choice, please don't force your views on me. I bought the dog, I bought the baseball bat, who are you to tell me what to do with my property? Live and let live, pushy dog rights activist” If this makes you uncomfortable, the same discomfort should be applied to eating meat. Just like the dog’s preferences should be valued in this situation, the cows or pigs should be valued in your decision to eat them.


### Plants feel pain.

When looking at the hard science, plants do not have a central nervous system to feel pain. According to our best understanding of the world and basic psychology, a brain and sensory data is necessary for the experience of pain. This is what plants lack, and what humans, and other nonhuman animals have. This is why we feel pain, and therefore, why plants don't.

When making this point, people often point to one specific study of one certain plant. Even if this is true, I can easily say we shouldn't eat that plant, but we are still able to eat lettuce, kale, soy, apples, etc. Each of these plants would also have to be proven to feel pain. 

Beyond this, even if this argument is bought, we kill more plants to feed livestock than we do to feed ourselves. Cows and other livestock eat 6x more plants to make a meal than if we just ate the plants directly. We kill 6x more plants under the omnivorous world, so even with this argument, you should go vegan because livestock eat so much plant.

  

We are smarter than animals.

If you believe that the fact that you are smarter than some animals makes you justifiable in killing them, you would also have to apply that logic consistently to say that anything that doesn't meet a certain intelligence threshold is justified in being killed. If a cow has intellegence X, and this is your only factor in staying cows can be killed, any human that also meets intelligence X could also be justifiably killed. Thus you would be forced to say that anyone with an equal intelligence to a cow, such as a baby, mentally disabled person, or a dog would also be killed and eaten ethically.  

  

No ethical consumption under capitalism.

This means you think there are absolutely no rules surrounding responsible consumption. If a slave business was started in a capitalist country, you would be forced to concede that it's not wrong to buy these slaves (since it's in capitalism), and thus we have no reason to boycott buying them. “It's ok for me to buy slaves since we live in capitalism, and there's no ethical consumption under capitalism.”

  

Our ancestors ate meat to survive.

This is true. We don't need meat anymore though, especially since we're not hunter gatherers anymore, and especially since we have a lot more substitutes than ever before. Unlike back then, it's possible to live an easy, meat-free life.

  

If you were on a desert island, you would eat it.

The issue is, as said before, I'm not on a desert island. I have bountiful vegan alternatives offered to me. The choice for me isnt between starving to death on a hot island or eating a pig, the choice is getting a slightly different tasting burger. Even if I say I would eat a pig on a desert island, that doesn't change my responsibility to others when I'm not on an island.

  

We give them life in the first place, it's better they exist momentarily than not at all.

This is the view I held for way too long. If we accept this, then we will also have to accept that it is always OK to birth a child. If I intended to create a child, simply to abuse it brutally until 3 years old and then murder it, I wouldnt say I did that child a favor. It would have been better for that child if it had never been born because of the sheer amount of suffering they experienced. The same goes for animals. They would be better off not to have been born to experience the sheer amount of pain they go through on a daily basis.

  

Canine teeth are for tearing meat.

Evolutionary design doesn't necessarily mean we should do that thing. Just because we are born with two kidneys does not mean that it is a bad thing to donate one of them to a close friend who needs it. Just because we are built a certain way doesn't justify what you can do with that feature.

Also, our teeth structure is much closer to chimpanzees and apes than carnivores. Chimps and apes eat a vast majority of plants, with the exception of a few bugs. Our teeth look nothing like the mandibles of a lion or other great predator, our teeth are more herbivoric by nature if anything.

  

Morality is subjective.

If morality is subjective, then any atrocity can be justified. If a nazi says “killing jewish people is ok” and you say “killing jewish people is bad,” you provide no reason to prefer your side. If morality is just based on culture and taste, your statement that nazis are bad is just as universal and valid as chocolate is better than vanilla ice cream.” Thus, the idea that morality is subjective is untenable.

  

Veganism is colonialism

People make this argument without understanding the biggest reason for the destruction of indiginous land, which is animal agriculture. The only reason these areas are wiped is to feed omnivores. By being vegan, you help indiginous people way more than you hurt

As a more direct response to this, although I would ‘enforce my morality’ on indiginous people, I would also ‘enforce my morality’ on a country practicing slavery, or activley killing innocent members of the population. Morality is universal, so it doesn't matter what culture you are from, the same rules of morality apply.

  

Humane killing is OK

Humane killing is an oxymoron. If you wouldn't feel comfortable killing your dog to put them down in the same way a cow is slaughtered, then it's clearly not humane.

What even is “humane killing?” If anyone can propose an economically and environmentally sustainable way to slaughter animals, su :).

“Humane rape is OK” “Humane slavery is OK” “Humane child trafficking is OK” The issue with these are that they simply arent possible. The definition of humane is “having or showing compassion or benevolence.” Killing, no matter it's form, to a creature that doesnt want to be killed will never be “humane”

  

Dairy or eggs are OK

The dairy and egg industry is the meat industry. What do you think happens after a hen stops laying or a cow runs out of milk? They are killed. By buying these products, you are supporting the exact industry that kills animals. 

Even if cows or chickens weren't killed, they are still caged, have their babies buried alive, enslaved, have their eyes burned, have their beaks/tails ripped off, legs broken, and social activity revoked. Thus, torture is somehow ok, but murder isnt. It's an insanely inconsistent position to be vegetarian or pescatarian because you both value the cow enough not to kill it, but continue to torture it. 

  

I'm trying my best and that is enough

Doing meatless Mondays, although a good start, aren't enough. A slave owner letting their slaves out on mondays, but continuing to enslave them the other 6 days of the week is still immoral. Likewise, you would still call the cops on someone who “only abuses their dog 6 days a week” By acknowledging that what you are doing is immoral, but not completely stopping it is immoral. 

  

I won't make a difference

In my one year of veganism, I have saved nearly 400,000 gallons of water, 10,000 sq feet for forest, 7,000 pounds of CO2, and over 350 individual animal lives. That is a massive difference. 

Even though these might not be big numbers in the total grand scheme of things, all of these statistics do make a legitimate difference, especially in the lives of over 350 individuals.

If you also support voting federally, or boycotting other businesses at all, the same logic would apply here. A small difference is still a meaningful difference.

  

I support government action, not individual action

Why? This is directly an issue of supply and demand, so although government help would be nice in the process of animal liberation, it will take an insanely long time to get there with the government alone. Until then, we have to be consistent to attack the government to change. Why would they listen to people who want to end meat, but still eat meat?

Not only that, but with this, the act of boycotting would be unnecessary in any situation because if we leave everything to the government, there is no room for personal responsibility for your consumption.

  

I can't afford it monetarily

The right vegan diet will be cheaper than an omnivorous diet. According to the market research group Kantar, a vegan diet will actually be 40% cheaper than meat or eggs or dairy. The idea that veganism is only for the uber wealthy is a completely outdated idea, as many people at or below the federal poverty line are able to make it work. If you need help meal planning, I'm also here to help.


I can't afford it mentally

There is no supported scientific link between a balanced vegan diet and worsening/ bad mental health. There are deficiencies that can exist that can worsen mental health, but supplements such as iron or B12 do exist, and in most cases aren't necessary with a healthy diet.

Also, mental health is not a justification for animal abuse. 

Imagine this scenario:

Hi all, I was with my friend and experiencing a lot of stress that day when I spotted a stray dog. In my family, we were raised to take our emotions out on animals, so I cornered the dog and kicked it until I felt better. It made me feel really good and it was necessary for my mental health. Unfortunately, the dog died in the process. I know it's sad that the dog had to die, but I needed to use this dog for my own mental and physical well being. Also, that dog probably had a good life, so there's no reason to feel bad for it. 

No. You would never make this argument. In all situations, it is immoral to physically or emotionally abuse another innocent being because of poor mental health.
