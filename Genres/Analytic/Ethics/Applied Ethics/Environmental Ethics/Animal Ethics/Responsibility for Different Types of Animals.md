## Responsibility Based on Suffering Prevention
See [[Animal Welfare]]

All animals, no matter their relation to us, ought not suffer

## Responsibility Based on Causal Relation
See [[Palmer]]

### Pets
Humans both create and form dependent relations with pets, leading to more responsibility
	This connects well with obligations to children from parenthood

Thus, "It seems reasonable to argue that where humans, as individuals, assume roles of material provision for particular urban animals that lead to dependence, humans should accept, as individuals, ethical responsibility for those actions" Placing Animals in Urban Environmental Ethics 2003, 70

### Wild Urban Animals
Humans have causal responsibility for urban wild animals existing where they are (otherwise they would not be urban)

But it doesnt seem obvious that we have direct moral duties, thus the only thing we owe urban wild animals is wildlife corridors, considerate architecture, and proper city planning 

### Opportunistic Urban Animals
Opportunistic animals choose to follow humans to settlements, and eat scraps. They initiated contact with humans

Thus, it seems prima facie true that we have no special positive obligations to protect them

### Feral Urban Animals
There are *way* too many possible cases that need to be considered. Needs to be determined on a case by case basis.
