# Animal-Computer Interaction (ACI)
See [[Singer]], [[Mancini]]
Entire page rests on assumptions of [[Why animals matter]]

###### "Many AI systems have significant impacts on animals, with the total number of animals affected annually likely to reach the tens or even hundreds of billions." AI Ethics: The case for including animals


## Why the Field is Necessary

All Animal-Computer Interactions in the past have been wholly anthropocentric and the impact of the tech does not account for the animals interacting with the technology. ACI Manifesto, 1

Nonhuman animals cannot communicate their feelings directly to an AI, so it needs a human intermediary in order to produce results that are not only current in relation to sentience data, but in relation to animal wellbeing. AI ethics the case for including animals 5.1

As an extension, if humans are being harmed by an AI, we always have the option to turn it off. Animals do NOT have this ability, requiring extra care and caution in AI development. AI ethics the case for including animals 5.3

### Goals of ACI
ACI Manifesto, 70-72
- Improve animal life expectancy and quality of life
- Working within the system in order to maximize wellbeing and minimize harm to animals
- Foster the human-animal relationship with open communication (??)

### Ethical Principles of ACI
ACI Manifesto, 72
- Respect characteristics of all species, sans discrimination
- Treat human and nonhuman participants as equal individuals
- Only work with a species as long as the goal of said work is to benefit the species
- Don't abuse human or nonhuman participants, psychologically or physically
- Allow possibility to withdraw for all participants, regardless of species
- Obtain informed consent from all parties (???)

## Applications and Gaps

### Vehicles
 There is no evidence of AI with any valuation of nonhuman animals as moral subjects (except pets)

### Scale
A study headed by Fernanda Delborgo Abra estimated that in São Paulo State (Brazil) alone, 39,605 “medium” and “large-sized” mammals were killed on roads by vehicles per year . AI ethics the case for including animals, 3.2.2

### Search Data
Could search data be manipulated in order to make it such that chicken cooking videos are marked as animal abuse? Perhaps. 

### Animal Health Data
Currently, AI are being used to track the health of animals on farms seeing where sick animals are.
	Could this be used to track abuse of animals by a governing body?

### Animal Replacement 
If AI can test the efficacy of drugs, or find specific chemicals used to make good meatless food, AI can serve an incredible good.
