[[Singer]] on Thicc EA

(1) Suffering and death from lack of food, shelter and medical care are bad. 

(2) If it is in your power to prevent something bad from happening, without sacrificing anything nearly as important, it is wrong not to do so. 

(3) By donating to aid agencies, you can prevent suffering and death from lack of food, shelter and medical care, without sacrificing anything nearly as important. 

(4) Therefore, if you do not donate to aid agencies, you are doing something wrong (Singer 1972: 231–3; Singer 2009: 15–16). [[The Life You Can Save]], 15-16 (echoed similarly in [[Practical Ethics]], 200)
