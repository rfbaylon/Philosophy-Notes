## EA is too homogenous, hierarchical, and insular
[Very Important Internal Critique](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/54vAiSFkYszTWWWv4/doing-ea-better-1)
"The Collective Intelligence literature suggests epistemic communities should be diverse, egalitarian, and open to a wide variety of information sources. EA, in contrast, is relatively homogenous, hierarchical, and insular. This puts EA at serious risk of epistemic blind-spots."

### EA Values Orthodoxy

#### The Orthodoxy
EA is mostly comprised of people with very similar demographic, cultural, and eductational backgrounds
EA also mistakes value-alignment and seniority with expertise
<small>Orthodoxy includes (but is not limited to):
Longtermism, (Total) Utilitarianism, Rationalist Epistemics, Progressivist view of History, Techno-Utopian Approach to X Risks</small>
Hiring practices also HEAVILY favor those in the orthodoxy due to the rationalist epistemic groundwork

#### The Solution
Diveristy is studied to be one of the biggest determinants of collective intelligence

### EA selectively hears critiques

#### Shallow Vs Deep Critiques
EA is incredibly open to shallow critiques (which is awesome), but the communitu is structuted such that deep critiques are sysyemically suppressed
Shallow: 
- Changes of emphasis or minor structural/methodological adjustments
- Easily conceptualised as “optimising” “updates” rather than cognitively difficult qualitative switches
Deep: 
- Implying that people may have invested considerable amounts of time/effort/identity in something when they perhaps shouldn’t have

Case Study: This article ([The Effective Altruism movement is not above conflicts of interest](https://medium.com/@sven_rone/the-effective-altruism-movement-is-not-above-conflicts-of-interest-25f7125220a5)) was not chosen for any awards and written under a pseudonym for fear of professional retaliation. Comments agreeing are heavily downvoted.

#### The Importance of Anonymity
Dee critiques drastically reduce funding odds [Source](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/54vAiSFkYszTWWWv4/doing-ea-better-1#fn-G9cEcNwwDByz6nEDu-22)

"Zoe Cremer and Luke Kemp [lost](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/gx7BEkoRbctjkyTme/democratising-risk-or-how-ea-deals-with-critics-1) “sleep, time, friends, collaborators, and mentors” as a result of writing [Democratising Risk](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3995225), a paper which was critical of some EA approaches to existential risk.[(Source)](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/54vAiSFkYszTWWWv4/doing-ea-better-1#fn-G9cEcNwwDByz6nEDu-23) Multiple senior figures in the field attempted to prevent the paper from being published, largely out of fear that it would offend powerful funders. This saga caused significant conflict within CSER throughout much of 2021."

### Over-Quantification

#### [[Bayes]]ianism
"EA is highly culturally quantitative, which is optimal for some problem categories but not others. Trying to put numbers on everything causes information loss and triggers anchoring and certainty biases. Individual Bayesian Thinking, prized in EA, has significant methodological issues. Thinking in numbers, especially when those numbers are subjective “rough estimates”, allow one to justify anything comparatively easily, and can lead to wasteful and immoral decisions." (See [[Bayes]])
	"For instance, Bayesian estimates are heavily influenced by one’s initial figure (one’s “prior”), which, especially when dealing with complex, poorly-defined, and highly uncertain and speculative phenomena, can become subjective (based on unspecified values, worldviews, and assumptions) to the point of arbitrary."
There is not even evidence that individual Bayesian thinking is even more fruitful lol

Research in existential risk is especially unreliable (What is the basis for priors?)

## Many EA beliefs have very little support
BOOKMARK: Expertise & Rigour

### EA people speak with way too mjuch confidence, ignore debate
People within the EA sphere are listened to, and a lot of credibility that EA researchers have are unfairly prioritized over non EA researchers. 
Example: 80k Hours gave Sam Bankman Fried  a platform to discuss all EA issues, he doesnt know anything besides finance (at best)

### Reading lists are Narrow
All EA houses only have Msackkill, Ord, and Bostrom. Blog posts are favored over sholarly research

### Reinventing the Wheel
Diseaster Risk Reduction, Futures Studies and Science & Technology Studies are not a part of EA for some reason, despite having the necesssary framework to help with this research. (This is mostly for X risk research)




## EA interests align suspiciously with donor interests

## EA decision making is highly centralized, opaque, and unaccountable

## Over Demandingness

For consider, even if global poverty were eliminated entirely, there will still always be causes to which you could contribute that would be more valuable than pursuing your own interests (such as generating benefits to future generations). This is the paradoxical over demandingness of utilitarianism identified by philosophers like [Bernard Williams](https://www.routledge.com/Ethics-and-the-Limits-of-Philosophy/Williams/p/book/9780415610148) and [Susan Wolf](https://www.pdcnet.org/jphil/content/jphil_1982_0079_0008_0419_0439): that a world of utilitarians would be a world incapable of happiness.
[https://www.abc.net.au/religion/why-effective-altruism-is-not-effective/13310708]
	A2: The existence of perfection (and its impossibility of attainment) doesn't mean that we ought to not try at all. this would be a Nirvana [[Fallacy]]. 
  

## Takes away systemic responsibility

However, it seems to me that Singer fails to integrate this elementary point fully into effective altruism. When we identify a problem within our society that we think we should be solved — such as children not getting a proper education or unsafe roads — we do not merely pass a hat around for people to contribute as much money as they individually feel they can without sacrificing anything important. Instead, we organize ourselves as citizens to place this on the political agenda in order to get the improvements we want funded from compulsory (progressive) taxation, and to have specific institutions and individuals assigned responsibility, authority, and accountability for implementing them.
	[https://www.abc.net.au/religion/why-effective-altruism-is-not-effective/13310708]
		A2: The only way we can increase government spending on effective altrust projects is precisely by showing political demand for it by giving in the first place
		A2: Even if it is the fault of a system that we are in this situation, why perpetuate this system by hoarding? Even if it is not your fault this happened, that doesnt necessarily mean that you have no obligation to change anything.

## Triage
Helping people currently in poverty survive will lead to more people born into poverty as the survivors will have more kids who will be miserable.
Bonus meme: Overpopulation bad
	A2: There are an *incredible* amount of *incredible* charities that specifically do work in contraception in 3rd world countries. 
	A2: The reason their kids will be miserable is because there is not enough money going to these people in need. With more money, economies can develop and quality of life can go up.
	A2: Overpopulation is a myth: the wrold produces 7x more food than we can eat, so thus world hunger os merely a distribution problem. Giving is not a zero sum game - there is hope for bettering quality of life.


## Lack of Goals

EA isnt goal oriented; where one donates money is cause neutral. It will donate to whatever works. This also means that goal oriented social movements will outperform EA because goal oriented causes are statistically more successful

## National Priority
We need to take care of ourselves before we can help other countries. There are so many problems in our country, we need to help those close to us first
	A2: The logical conclusion of this argument is that people from different counties have less intrinsic worth than people from our country.

## Property Rights
I *earned* this money fair and square, why should I give it to someone else if I earned it?
	A2: This critique would equally apply to taxation
	A2: See [[Labor Theory of Value]] and [[Marx]] generally, because no you didnt


## Moralizes over which problems are the worst, is elitist

By contrast, defective altruism is—by the admission of its proponents—an approach that not only unjustifiably claims the moral high ground in giving decisions, but also implements this bold claim by weighing causes and beneficiaries against one another. In this, it is not moral, but rather, moralistic in the worst sense of the word.
	“the language of charity is damaging in this context because it tacitly reinforces the idea that there is a moral hierarchy that separates giver and receiver”
	[https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_elitist_philanthropy_of_so_called_effective_altruism]
		A2: Holy shit this argument is dumb. If you genuinely think it is wrong to decide a lesser of two evils, drinking coffee and being shot in the head are equally evil. 
  

# Methodological Critiques
[Iason Gabriel-Effective Altruism and its Critics (1).pdf]
See [[Gabriel]]

Note:
**givewell formally acknowledged the 3 objections below and now incorporates multifaceted analyses
All 3 critiques come from Iason Gabriel

### Observational Bias
 , we prioritize things that are easier to observe

RCTs!

RCT = Randomized Controlled Trials

Methodology used by many global health EAs, used mostly to measure effectiveness of medicine

“‘gold-standard method of testing ideas in other sciences,’ such as medicine.”

Can ONLY be applied small villages tho! 

-> leads to observational bias
  
### Quantification Bias
lets measures slip through cracks

To see how these factors can influence decision-making, consider the following

Choice: Medicine. According to recent estimates, condom distribution is a far more effective way of minimising the harm caused by HIV/AIDS than the provision of anti-retrovirals. Whereas anti-retrovirals help people who already have the virus, condoms help to prevent many more people from becoming infected. As a donor, you must choose between funding one of two national action plans. The first allocates the entire sum of money to condom distribution. The second allocates 90% to condom distribution and 10% to anti-retrovirals.

  Assuming that the evidence in favour of condom distribution is reliable, effective altru-

ists will tend to favour the first plan because it saves the greatest number of lives. Yet most governments and populations affected by the pandemic have rejected strategies

that leave people with HIV/AIDS untreated. One reason for this is recognition that it may be better to live in a society where one can hope to receive medical treatment if one is sick than to live in one where the largest numbers of people get treated overall.32 Hope is valuable in this context either because it leads people to feel better about their lives or because it simply is feeling better about one’s life. On either view, it contributes to wellbeing in a way that the

original verdict overlooks. Hope is also an important resource for people who are undergoing serious hardship, encouraging them to tackle problems they might other-wise, in resignation, fail address. Taken together, these effects show why we cannot move directly from information about the most cost-effective intervention, on a DALY per capita basis, to reliable conclusions about the best overall policy or program.33

### Instrumental Bias
 , technocratic solutions, not democratic solutions 
Between deciding whether or not to hire a professional company to build a well or hiring the community that needs it, it could eb better to do the latter to promote autonomy and self esteem

  

Purely data based analyses miss the latter ‘good’ which is unfortunate.

  
# Counterfactuals

Would other people donatein your place if you don't?

“It is likely that big charities would pick up the slack of individuals”

  

Is this true? Gabriels paper doesnt cite any source for this, but it seems plausible

Maybe here -----> (Ord op. cit.; MacAskill 2015 op. cit., pp. 59–62).
