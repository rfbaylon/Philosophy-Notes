[[Kant]]
You create morality as a necessary condition of the rational will. By your own rational nature, you will yourself to fall in line with the categorical imperative, as doing so would be out of line of your wills own nature. The laws of the CI are both made by each individual and universal at the same time. ([[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]] 117)

#MyArgument 
"Why should I be moral?" -> "Why should I do what I should do?""
These two questions seem to be asking the same thing, as morality is just the study of what agents should do. 
Thus the answer is clear: You should do what you should do because you *should.* this is tautologically true.
