# Noncognitivism
See [[Ayer]], [[R.M. Hare]]
Our moral judgements express feelings and emotions, they have no truth value
Noncognitivists agree with error theorists: there are no moral facts, but disagree on truth aptness.

Ayer: Stealing money?!? BOOOOOO!!!!!!!!
Hare: Stealing disgusts me! 

## [[Moore]]'s Open Question Argument


# Quasi-Realism
Branch of Noncognitivism

Technically, moral statements dont talk about anything truth apt, but it still makes sesne to talk about moral propositions as if they were truth apt.
