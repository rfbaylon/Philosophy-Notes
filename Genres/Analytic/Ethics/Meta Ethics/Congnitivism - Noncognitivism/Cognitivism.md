# Cognitivism
Morality is truth apt. They can be true or false
You can be a cognitivist [[Moral Realism]] (some statements of morality are true independent of belief) or [[Moral Antirealism]] (all moral statements are strictly false) (AKA error theory)

See [[Frege]], [[Geach]], [[Sidgwick]]


### [[Frege]]-[[Geach]] Embedding Problem
#### Or, The Problem of Unasserted Contexts

(P1) **If** tormenting the cat is bad, getting your little brother to do it is bad  
(P2) Tormenting the cat is bad.  
_Ergo_, getting your little brother to torment the cat is bad.
.
	This formulation of 'bad' creates a [[Private Language]] ([[Wittgenstein]]) which is incomprehensible to the outside world. 
	Using a conditional in P1 means that a noncognitivists cannot make sense of the statement. Because it is a conditional, no feeling or emotion is expressed in P1.
	The noncognitivist has to hold that the above proof is invalid as the usage of "bad" in P1 (as part of a conditional) is different than its usage in P2 (expressing emotion). This is a [[Fallacy]] of equivocation

This is what Geach has called The Frege Point: “A thought may have just the same content whether you assent to its truth or not; a proposition may occur in discourse now asserted, now unasserted, and yet be recognizably the same proposition” (Geach 1965, 449).

### [[Sidgwick]]'s argument from marginal cases
 Clearly there is a distinction between me saying "This food is delicious" and "this food is morally correct," these are *obviously* different things. ([[The Methods of Ethics]], 27)

Given noncognitivism, ethical statements cannot be criticized [[Practical Ethics]], 8
