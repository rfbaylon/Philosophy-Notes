Externalism: If someone is morally required to do X, they do *NOT* have sufficient reason to do X.
Internalism: If someone is morally required to do X, they have sufficient reason to do X

[[Nagel]]: Externalists have to buy into Noncognitivism (See [[Cognitivism & Noncognitivism]]) as without reason as a grounding for what morality is, it necessarily falls back to feelings.  ([[The Possibility of Altruism]], 8)

# Internalism

--
Reason (as motive) -> Desire -> Action
OR 
Appetite -> Desire -> Action
-

- Note that in order to argue for internalism, you dont have to claim *all* actions are motivated by reason, just that some are. 
	- Motivated desire: Desire motivated by reason
	- Unmotivated desire: Desire motivated by appetition

## Internalism
See [[Nagel]], [[Kant]], [[Spinoza]], [[Sidgwick]]

### [[Nagel]]'s Positive Prudential Argument
Prudential desire means that it is prudent to want something in the future that is undesirable right now (e.g., retirement) 
	**This argument is explored in depth here vvv
	See [[Prudence]]**

### [[Nagel]]'s Positive Altruistic Argument
Altruistic desire means that that one desires to do an action for a reason that it not self interest
	**This argument is explored in depth here vvv
	See [[Altruism & Egoism]]**

### [[Nagel]]'s Negative Argument
The externalist allows someone who has acknowledged that they ought to do X and has seen *why* they ought to do it to ask if they have any reason to do it. What does the "why" mean if not an appeal to reason? ([[The Possibility of Altruism]], 9)
By denying this view, the statement "Why do what I have reason to do?" is a legitimate question.

	See [[Why be Moral]]

### [[Sidgwick]]'s Negative Argument
We clearly discriminate something from ones own happiness from moral duties. For example, we can easily think of cases (e.g., sharing candy) where what is in one persons self interest is not in alignment of the moral law. The moral law is good for its own sake, where the egoist law is good for the subjects own sake. ([[The Methods of Ethics]], 26)

### Morality Presupposes Reason via the CI
See [[Kant]]
See [[Categorical Imperative]]
You create morality as a necessary condition of the rational will. By your own rational nature, you will yourself to fall in line with the categorical imperative, as doing so would be out of line of your wills own nature. The laws of the CI are both made by each individual and universal at the same time. ([[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]] 117)

### Argument from Circularity
#MyArgument 
"Why should I be moral?" -> "Why should I do what I should do?""
These two questions seem to be asking the same thing, as morality is just the study of what agents should do. 
Thus the answer is clear: You should do what you should do because you *should.* this is tautologically true.

# Externalism

--
Desire -> Reason -> Action

A consequence of this position:
	"From [[Bentham]]'s psychological doctrine that every human being always does aim at his own greatest apparent happiness, it would seem to follow that it is useless to point out to a man the conduct that would conduce to the greatest possible happiness unless you convince him at the same time that it would conduce to his own" ([[The Methods of Ethics]], 84-85)
