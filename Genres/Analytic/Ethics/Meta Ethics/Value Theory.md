## A2 Pure Hedonism

### The Paradox of Hedonism
[[Sidgwick]], [[Buddhism]]; "The impulse of pleasure, if too predominant, defeats its own aim" ([[The Methods of Ethics]] 48)
#WIP: Needs elaboration

### Desire is Harmful
Many consider desire as essentially *harmful* ([[Schopenhauer]], [[Buddhism]], [[Cioran]], [[Lacan]])

# Rational Desire

## Rational Desire
See [[Sidgwick]]

### [[Sidgwick]]'s Answer
"An object is good iff it were to be desired, with strength proportioned to the degree of desirability if it were judged attainable under voluntary action, supposing the desirer to possess a perfect forecast. emotional as well as intellectual, of the state of attainment or fruition" ([[The Methods of Ethics]], 111)''
	I.e., something is good if a rational being should desire it, assuming equal concern for all ([[Nagel]]?)

# Objective List Theory

Things are good for any and all beings iff those things are on the list of goods

# Perfectionism

We can talk about good and bad instances of specific 

"A good... animal is one that is well fitted or endowed with respect to its parts, operations, actions, and its desires/emotions; whether it is thus well fitted or endowed is determined by whether these four aspects well serve (1) its individual survival, (2) the continuance of its species, (3) its characteristic freedom from pain and characteristic enjoyment, and (4) the good functioning of its social group (if it is in fact a social animal). ([[On Virtue Ethics]], 202)

The truth of such evaluations does not depend in any way on my wants, interest, or values. They are scientific (thus objective) and derived from zoology, botany, ethology, etc. These findings lead to imprecise but good general truths about the goods of specific animals. Within the fuzziness around the edges of being a good X, there are more specific rules of thumb surrounding being good fxs or gxs. For example, male bees are not defective if they dont produce honey, but may be defective if they dont have sex. ([[On Virtue Ethics]], 202 - 205)

## Perfectionism

### Flexibility

### Nonspeciesist

## A2 Perfectionism

### Perfectionism Requires Competition
For any goods a being has, there will be a finite amount of them for each individual. Thus, individuals become more imperfect at the expense of others. Perfectionism is bent towards inequality, especially when perfectionism is combined with aggregationism.
	A2: [[Spinoza]]: Perfection is non-competitive. Instances such as understanding, knowledge, and friendship do not impede (and may in fact advance!) the perfection of others.
