# Ought does NOT necessarily imply Can

### [[Sidgwick]]'s argument from counterexamples
It makes sense to claim that I ought to feel as a better man would feel (when being ill) despite it being entirely out of my control. 

### [[Sidgwick]]'s argument from practicality
- Even though, *technically,*  my life and will are determined, this belief will weaken the will to be moral among many, and thus not be espoused

Answering the question of Freewill has no bearing on moral facts. If we determine the end of morality to be aggregate happiness under a Libertarian Freewill, the adoption of Determinism bears no ground for rejecting the moral system. Freewill is *only* important in reference to his interests (descriptive) not to his duty (prescriptive). A moral act doesnt change in its value towards achieving its end if it is predetermined; the goal is still closer to being reached. ( See [[Free Will & Determinism]] , [[Consequentialism & Intentionalism]])
For example, if all planets were suddenly endowed with Libertarian Freewill, and only continued spinning because they willed it, astronomy wouldnt change. In the same way, we can talk about the science of how humans act and prescribe how they ought to act. These do not contradict each other.
