Internalism: If someone is morally required to do X, they have sufficient reason to do X

See [[Nagel]], [[Kant]], [[Spinoza]], [[Sidgwick]]

--
Reason (as motive) -> Desire -> Action
OR 
Appetite -> Desire -> Action
-

- Note that in order to argue for internalism, you dont have to claim *all* actions are motivated by reason, just that some are. 
	- Motivated desire: Desire motivated by reason
	- Unmotivated desire: Desire motivated by appetition




## [[Nagel]]'s Positive Prudential Argument
Prudential desire means that it is prudent to want something in the future that is undesirable right now (e.g., retirement)

## [[Nagel]]'s Positive Altruistic Argument

See [[Altruism]]**

## [[Nagel]]'s Negative Argument
The externalist allows someone who has acknowledged that they ought to do X and has seen *why* they ought to do it to ask if they have any reason to do it. What does the "why" mean if not an appeal to reason? ([[The Possibility of Altruism]], 9)
By denying this view, the statement "Why do what I have reason to do?" is a legitimate question.

## [[Sidgwick]]'s Negative Argument
We clearly discriminate something from ones own happiness from moral duties. For example, we can easily think of cases (e.g., sharing candy) where what is in one persons self interest is not in alignment of the moral law. The moral law is good for its own sake, where the egoist law is good for the subjects own sake. ([[The Methods of Ethics]], 26)
