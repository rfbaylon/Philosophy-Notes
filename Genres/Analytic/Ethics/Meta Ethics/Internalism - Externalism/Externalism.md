Externalism: If someone is morally required to do X, they do *NOT* have sufficient reason to do X.

See [[Hume]], [[Haidt]], [[Bentham]], [[Hobbes]]

Desire -> Reason -> Action

[[Nagel]]: Externalists have to buy into [[Noncognitivism]] as without reason as a grounding for what morality is, it necessarily falls back to feelings.  ([[The Possibility of Altruism]], 8)

A consequence of this position:
	"From [[Bentham]]'s psychological doctrine that every human being always does aim at his own greatest apparent happiness, it would seem to follow that it is useless to point out to a man the conduct that would conduce to the greatest possible happiness unless you convince him at the same time that it would conduce to his own" ([[The Methods of Ethics]], 84-85)
