### [[Hume]]'s Is / Ought Problem
Humans believe their pleasure to be good and pain to be bad, but according to Philosopher David Hume, that doesn't mean we are morally obligated to feel pleasure or avoid suffering. Just because it is the case, doesn't mean it ought to be. ‘Is’ and ‘Ought’ are in two completely different realms of description, one describing the natural world, and the other describing the moral landscape, so no descriptive or ‘is’ premises can possibly describe what should happen
	A2: [[Kant]]


### CosmicSkeptic's Argument
(need link) #Cite 
Let's say that you live in a town that all citizens happen to believe that yellow is the best color, when deciding what color to paint the town statue, the town ought to decide to paint it yellow, because they all believe yellow is the best color. Does this mean that yellow is objectively the best color? No. How much a person likes a color is subjective, based on feeling, and cannot possibly be grounded in pure reason. If a person thinks they should paint it blue, while it is also true that they believe that yellow is the best color, that person would be wrong. Again, not because yellow is the objectively best color, but because if we run under the assumption that they believe yellow is the best color (which they have to, by definition) then we can objectively explain to them why yellow would be a better color to paint the statue.

Now let's take this into morality. Lets replace Yellow with pleasure. All humans naturally feel like pleasure is good for them, subjectively. Pleasure is a subjective experience, which cannot exist a priori or in other words without the human experience. So. We all naturally, yet subjectively feel as if pleasure is good and that we ought to live in a ‘yellow’ society that acknowledges our natural experiences. If someone wants to do a blue action, in this case stab someone to feel pleasure, we can objectively explain to them that a society in which people murder eachother for fun would be at odds with their natural inclination towards personal pleasure. 

I.e., just because everyone agrees that something is bad, doesnt actually make it bad metaphysically.
	A2: We can still do morality within this schema, it will just be psudo-objective

### The Combinatory Problem
How exactly do we weigh competing interests against eachother? it seems to be a purely intuitive method that cannot create any objective answers.
	A2: [[J.S. Mill]]: One has to treat competing claims as if they came from one distinct person. All of the claims in the world must be from the perspective of an amalgamated individual with all of the interests of everyone always.
		A2A2: [[Nagel]]: This is not only unimaginable (and thus unhelpful), but it entirely ignores the separateness of persons.
	A2: [[Rawls]] All parties ought to act as though they were behind a [[veil of ignorance]], and act in their own best interest given that they do not know which position they could occupy after teh veil has been lifted
		A2A2: [[Nagel]]: This denies that peoples lives as they are are not potentialities, but genuine actalities. This also reduces into a form of subjectivism; What happens when people disagree when behind the veil?
	A2: [[Nagel]]: "The choice of an interpersonal weighting principle be made under the condition that the chooser expects to lead *all* of the lives in question, not as a single super-life ([[J.S. Mill]]), but as a set of distinct individual lives, each of them a complete set of experiences and activity" [[The Possibility of Altruism]], 141
