### 3 Approaches to Solving the Grounding Problem

#### [[Categorical Imperative]]

#### [[Utilitarianism]]

#### [[Virtue Ethics]]




### The Ontological Argument
P1: Ethics may be real
P2: If there is a 50% chance your next action will have no moral value and a 50% chance it will have a terrible moral value then you should not commit that action
P3: Based on (2) and (1) if ethics may be real then you should act as if it’s real.
Conclusion: If you accept premise 3 then ethics must be real, as saying you “should act” as if ethics is real is in and of itself a moral statement and thus as long as you believe (1) and (2) ethics must be real.
