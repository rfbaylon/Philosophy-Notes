# Intentionalism

Two senses of intentionality
- (intention) Done on purpose
- (intentionality) Done in pursuit of some end
	This distinction in phil of mind needs to be drawn out for moral intentionalism to have any meaningful pull.

#### From Duty / With Duty
See [[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]]
Duty is defined as "good will exposed to subjective limitations"

From Duty: The only maxim that can create moral good
In Accordance With Duty: Your action happens to be the right answer, but there was no good intention behind it

"For if any action is to be morally good, it is not enough that it should *conform* to the moral law - it must also be done *for the sake* of the moral law*" [[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]], 57-58)
	Ex. A student guesses 69 as the answer to a math problem because it was funny, another does the calculations behind the mathematics and shows their work to arrive at an answer of 69. Once clearly acted from principles of mathematics, the other one happened to accord with the principles of mathematics.

## Intentionalism
See [[Kant]]

### [[Kant]]'s Argument from Apriority of the Will
The will, and broadly morality, is a priori
Morality cannot be a posteriori
	Why, according to Kant, cant morality be a posteriori? #Questions
		"Kant thought the [[Deontology]] must be discovered _a priori_—through reason—because, as a fundamental moral law applying to all rational beings, it cannot be discovered through mere experience: one cannot learn how one _should_ act from how people _do_ act." ([Source](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-epistemology-a-priori/#AnalPrio))
			([[Hume]]'s guillotine -  see [[Moral Realism & Antirealism]])
Consequences are a posteriori
Therefore consequences have no moral weight as they are outside of the apriority of the moral law. 
[[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]], 75-77

### Argument from Abilism
People with cognitive impairments (mentally disabled people, babies, league of legends players) ought not be held as morally accountable for their actions as people with money, knowledge, and power. 

### The Doctrine of Double Effect
See [[Catholicism]]
See [[Killing Vs. Letting Die]]
If an action has two effects, and the agent intends for one while considering the other as a side effect, the action is moral. 
For example, if an action is taken (Euthanizing someone) in order to reduce their pain, but it has the unwanted side effect of killing them, then it is OK because the unwanted side effect was not intended
	A2: By doing an action and understanding its consequences, you *clearly* intend all of the consequences that sprout from that action. This argument seems weaselly.
	A2: [[Singer]] If a company is polluting a river, but is only intending to increase efficiency, they are not then wiped of their moral blame when they say that pollution was just a side effect.

# Consequentialism

## Consequentialism
See [[J.S. Mill]], [[Bentham]]

## A2 Consequentialism

### Many-Worlds Objection
If the many-worlds interpretation of QM is correct (that all possible worlds *actually* exist), no matter what occurs, there is equal outcomes. If you cause icnredible amounts of suffering, it will not matter *morally* because by doing that, you prevented a different world from taking on the suffering caused in this one. If we value all actually existing, alike suffering equally, all outcomes are equally good. 

### The Agent Matters
See [[Hursthouse]]
If there is a callous, cold, snarky, or pompous doctor who prescibes the same medicine as an empathetic and kind doctor it still seems like tehre is some point of failure on the part of the former. Despite the outcomes being the same, it there is still a failure to take serious the gravity and emotions of their patient. ([[On Virtue Ethics]], 48)
	A2: The callous attitude can still be taken into consideration as a consequence of the doctors action. The emotional pain suffered by the patient due to the doctors coldness still needs to be considered in the mroal calculus, meaning that the consequentialist and the virtue ethicist stand on the same ground in the end.
