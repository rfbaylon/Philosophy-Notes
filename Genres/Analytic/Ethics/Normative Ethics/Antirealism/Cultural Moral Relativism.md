# Moral Relativism
Aka "that which is good is determined by culture"
See Early [[Marx]]

- Note: This theory doesn't say that what we believe to be moral is determined by society, but that goodness is laden within social norms.

## Moral Relativism

### Argument from Moral Pluralism
According to [[Singer]], relativism sprung up in the colonial era as people learned that things considered immoral in Europe were wholesome in other countries across the world (E.g., promiscuous sex). The basis of this argument is that since there are so many different moral systems, it seems to point to the fact that what is good is determined by society. Since moral belief seems so varied, it seems to be impossible to pin one down as *the* moral system.+
	A2: Just because a lot of people believe different things doesnt mean that there is no objective answer to a question. If a large amount of a poluation believed the earth were flat doesnt discredit the mathematics, physics, and scientific inquiry done to prove the earth is not flat. There can be a fact of the matter despite disagreement among people. 

### We ought to respect other cultures
Given that each individual is a part of a different culture with entirely varied systems of belief, we ought not impose ourselves over other cultures as there is no reason to value one system over another.
	A2: this argument actually defeats moral relativism. By claiming that we *ought to* respect other cultures, independent of what our culture claims, we create a normative principle outside of cultural relativism, thus defeating cultural relativism. 

### Imperialist Critique of Universalism
If we grant moral objectivism. then it will justify destruction of other nations and colonialism. This is heavily related to [[White Man's Burden]].  If there is a true universal moral truth, it creates a hierarchy of nations that would justify teaching third world nations to abandon their culture, tradition, etc., for a more moral way of life. This mode of thinking justified the entire colonization of Africa to make africans more 'civilized'
	A2: Just because Europeans believed that mortality placed a burden upon them to colonize africa doesnt mean that it was actually moral. 
	A2: Laden within this is the assumption that Imperialism is bad. This assumption can only come from an objective moral theory. If a society believes that colonialism is good, you are *objectively* incorrect that it is bad to invade other countries.
	A2: Just because moral universalism exits, that doesn't mean that it is automatically OK to invade other countries or individuals as the invasion could be morally worse than the initial action.
	A2: This isnt an argument against moral universalism, it is a mere consequence of universalism. The universalist could bite the bullet. 
	A2: Would it be cultural imperialism to tell nazis not to kill gay people? To tell Americans not to own slaves? 

## A2 Moral Relativism

### Moral Progress is Impossible
Under relativism, the norms of society are what dictate goodness. This means that anything that varies from the norm is worse. Under these conditions, any change in social norms by one person automatically makes that person wrong. An anti-slavery protest in the early 1800s would be definitionally wrong.
