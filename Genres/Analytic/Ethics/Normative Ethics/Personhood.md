## What is a Person?

[[Singer]]: A rational, self-aware being [[Practical Ethics]], 75
[[Kagan]]: In saying this I am using ‘person’ in the standard philosophical fashion, that is, as the
term for a being that is rational and self-conscious, aware of itself as one being among
others, extended through time [[What's Wrong With Speciesism]]

[[Locke]]: "A thinking intelligent being that has reason and reflection and can consider itself as itself, the same thinking thing, in different times and places"  #Cite

### Wild Vs Domestic?
If there is a pod of person dolphins, that does not mean we have an obligation to feed them. We do have an obligation to feed pets. 
[[Wells]] argues that Corvids fit into the space of liminal animals that are analogous to illegal immigrant animals
	"liminal animals." Liminal animals are those undomesticated animals whose living spaces overlap with our own, such as mice, rats, sparrows, raccoons, and deer" Liberty For Corvids 2022 235

## Case Study: Corvids
See [[Wells]]
Includes ravens, crows, magpies, jays, and jackdaws

Empirical research and fieldwork with corvids has shown evidence of episodic memory,30 planning and deception,31 complex social relationships,32 theory of mind,33 metacognition and self-recognition,34 as well as cognitive flexibility.  Liberty For Corvids 2022, 236

#### Temporal Extension

##### Episodic Memory
"Clayton and Anthony Dickinson found the first evidence of an episodic-like memory system in food-storing corvids, using a cache and recovery task that required the birds to recall unique caching events.s1 Western scrub jays (Aphelocoma californica) were given two different types of food to cache: perishable wax worms (the birds' preferred food item) and nonperishable peanuts. The birds were given two caching trials using different storage trays that could be uniquely identified by an arrangement of Lego bricks along the top of the tray. The two caching trials were separated by 120 hours, and the birds were allowed to recover the cached items four hours after the second caching trial. This means that one food item had been cached 124 hours prior to recovery, while the other was cached four hours before recovery. When the birds were taught that worms decay they would search for worms that were cached four hours before recovery. If, however, the worms were cached 124 hours prior and had likely degraded, the birds would instead search for the nonperishable peanuts." Liberty For Corvids 2022, 238

##### Planning
as well as caching food items that are expected to become rare in the future58 and caching food items for future consumption that they are currently satiated on. Liberty For Corvids 2022 , 239

#### Self Awareness

##### Metacognition
In 2008, the first corvid species, the European magpie (Pica pica), passed the mirror test. Liberty For Corvids 2022 , 240

##### General Intel
The scientists behind the study consider this evidence that the crows have an understanding of fluid dynamics that rivals that of 5-to-7-ycar-old human children. Liberty For Corvids 2022, 12
