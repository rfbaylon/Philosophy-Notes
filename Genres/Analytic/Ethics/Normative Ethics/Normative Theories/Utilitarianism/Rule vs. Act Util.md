## Strong Rule Utilitarianism (SRU)
Certain rules ought to be obeyed at all places and all times


## Weak Rule Utilitarianism (WRU)
See [[R.M. Hare]]
There are some general rules that we ought to follow in order to maximize happiness, but breaking the rules for the greater good isnt bad.
	A2: Does this not collapse into act utilitarianism? What is the greater good if not the most pleasure for the most amount of people?
