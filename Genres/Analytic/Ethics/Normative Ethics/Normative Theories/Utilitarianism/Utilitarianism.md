## Utility Hierarchy vs. No Hierarchy
See [[Sentience Hierarchies]]
[[J.S. Mill]]: There are higher and lower pleasures
[[Bentham]]: "Quantity of pleasure being equal, push-pin is as good as poetry" #Quote #Cite
	[[Singer]] and [[Sidgwick]] ([[The Methods of Ethics]] 109) agree

[[Sidgwick]]: Morality is built upon a hypothetical imperitave, yet is universal to all sentient beings ([[The Methods of Ethics]], 106)

"An object is good iff it were to be desired, with strength proportioned to the degree of desirability if it were judged attainable under voluntary action, supposing the desirer to possess a perfect forecast. emotional as well as intellectual, of the state of attainment or fruition" ([[The Methods of Ethics]], 111)''
	I.e., something is good if a rational being should desire it, assuming equal concern for all ([[Nagel]]?)





# My Attempted Proof at Utilitarianism

## Part A: Building Definitions of Good and Bad
I think Part A is valid, need peer edit #WIP 

P1. Every sentient being has interests.
P2: It is in a sentient being's best interest to have its interests fulfilled.
P3. The fulfillment of these interests is good for the being.
P4. The frustration of these interests is bad for the being.
P5. Morality is the study of what moral agents ought or ought not do.
P6. One ought to act morally
P7. One ought not act immorally
C1. Morality is the study of the maximization of realized preferences and minimized frustrated preferences

- Notes:
	- P1: I define 'sentient' here as the capability to value some states of being over others
	- P1: An interest is that which would increase a being's wellbeing
	- P3: An object is 'good' iff an omniscient, sentient, and rational agent would desire it
	- P3: An object is 'bad' iff an omniscient, sentient, and rational agent would dislike it
		- A more complete definition can be found above ([[The Methods of Ethics]], 111)

## Part B: Building Moral Equality

P1. No sentient beings interests are more important than another's, given that both desire fulfillment of their interests equally
P2. In other words, all sentient beings are morally equal

- Notes: 
	- P1 could seem as though it begs the question, but it does not. Equality in classification is the baseline for all things, and the burden of proof is upon the person claiming there *is* a difference. 

## Part C: Building Agency

P1. Ought implies can
P2. A moral agent ought to act as a moral agent ought to actÂ 
P3. Beings capable of understanding and enacting morality, are defined as moral agents
C1. Someone that does an action that accidentally harms another being did not act immorally
This individual *could not have* acted morally as they did not know of harms involed in their actions (CP1)
The contrapositive, that the action is immoral, would also commit us to the position that a boulder that falls on a turtle is immoral
C2. Thus, someone does an immoral action iff:
	A moral agent performs the action (CP3)
	Action X frustrates the realization of preferences of another sentient being (AP4)
	The agent is knowledgeable to the harms of Action (CC1)
C3. Someone that does an action that accidentally benefits another being did not act morally

- Notes:
- C3: This individual could not have acted morally as they did not know of benefits involed in their actions; The individual did not act to promote the good of others.
- 

## Part D: Building Objectivity

P1. objectivity is defined as measurablity
P2. Moral agents are sentient and themselves have preferences they want realized (AP1)
P3. Moral agents understand frustration of preferences and fulfillment of preferences (AP1)
P4. When a moral agent does an action, they intend a certain amount of pleasure or pain to come from it (CP3)
P5. This pleasure / pain is directly comparable to pleasure / pain they could experience
P6. The statement, "By doing Action X, i am knowledgable of, and thus intend for it to, cause pain equal to my experience of Sensation Y" is comprehensible and understandable
C1. Action X is immoral given the definition (CC2)
P7. A violation of interests via Y is thus the same as a violation of interests via X (BP1)
P8. The above statement measures pain derived from an action
C2. The morality of an action is thus measurable (DC1), (DP7)
C3. Thus, morality is objective, even though it is viewed through a subjective lens (DC2)

- Notes:
	- P1: The diameter of a tree is measurable, objective, and real, even though the tools used are used though a subjective lens.
