Based on 4 Principles
	(1) Reason alone cannot be a motive to the will, but rather is the “slave of the passions” '
	(2) Moral distinctions are not derived from reason 
	(3) Moral distinctions are derived from the moral sentiments: feelings of approval (esteem, praise) and disapproval (blame) felt by spectators who contemplate a character trait or action.
	(4) While some virtues and vices are natural, others, including justice, are artificial
