## A2 Contractarianism: [[Singer]]'s Argument From Marginal Cases
Under contract theory, only rational agents eligible to understand and respect a contract ought to be morally considered. 
	This excludes:
	- Babies
	- (permenantly) Mentally Disabled People
	- Nonhuman Animals
	- Future Humans (precluding us from worrying about climate change)
	- [[Destiny]] Humans who dont speak your language and you cant learn theirs (Clip of Destiny saying its OK to bomb north sentinel island as the inhabitants would never reciprocate value with him) #Cite 
		A2A2: [[Kagan]]: But babies and future humans have the *capacity* to enter reciprocal agreements. Mentally disabled people are *modally* valuable i.e., it is conceivable they *could* reciprocate vakues in a different world.
			A2A2A2: But at this point have you not entirely abandoned reciprocity all together? Why adopt a contractarian view at all if you believe this? [[Practical Ethics]], 64
