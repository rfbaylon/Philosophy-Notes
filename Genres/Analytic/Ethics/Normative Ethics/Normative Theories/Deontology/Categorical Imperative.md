See [[Kant]], [[Korsgaard]] 

## Definitions:
**Categorical Imperative**: You ought to do X
	A solely rational being or God will always do X.
**Hypothetical Imperative**: You ought to do X iff you want Y (Technical Imperitive); OR, You ought to do X iff you desire happiness (Pragmatic imperative)

**End-in-itself**: Something respected categorically, it has value by virtue of being itself
**End**: The end product of a hypothetical imperitive; "use X as a means to attain the end of Y"
**Kingdom of Ends**: A society by which all agents are treated as ends in themselves

**Perfect Duty**: A duty that is a strict moral duty; violating this is blameworthy and wrong
**Imperfect Duty**: A duty that is supererogatory; doing so would be good, but not required
**Self-Directed Duty**: A duty that concerns the self
**Other-Directed Duty**: A duty that concerns others besides the self
	Examples!
		Self directed perfect duty: Dont kill yourself
		Other-directed, perfect duty: Dont lie, murder, rape
		Self-directed imperfect duty: Have hobbies, create projects
		Other-directed imperfect duty: Help others achieve their ends

## Why Value Reason?
### [[Kant]]'s Teleological Argument for Valuing Reason
We ought to value reason above all else because all organs exist to complete their function. The fact that we have a rational organ (rather than no rational organ at all) must mean that it is more important than happiness (otherwise wouldnt nonhuman animals have rationality as well?)
([[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]], 62-63)
	A2: This is a Naturalistic [[Fallacy]]. Just because we have a faculty of rationality doesn't mean that we ought to prioritize it, or even use it.
	A2: Why cant rationality be used as a greater means to the end of happiness? why couldnt we claim that reason brought about maximal happiness as it allows us to understand morality

### #MyArgument for valuing reason
By asking for reasons for you to value reason, you implicitly already value reason.

###### If capacity to reason is the moral marker, it should be noted that ONLY rational beings are valuable in-themselves. This excludes nonhuman animals, some humans, and arguably babies

## Formulations of the CI
#### First 
Formulation:
"act only in such a way that I can also will that my maxim should become a universal law" ([[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]], 70)

#### Second Formulation
"Act in such a way that you treat humanity whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never simply as a means, but always at the same time as an end" ([[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]], 96)

#### Third Formulation
"Everyone should treat himself and all others never merely as a means, but always at the same time as an end in himself." ([[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]], 101)

#### General Formula 
1. I will do X in situation Y to accomplish Z
2. Everyone will do X in situation Y to accomplish Z
3. Find contradiction
4. Conclude

#### Example 1: Lying
**Other directed, perfect duty**
1. Develop a maxim:
"I will lie in order to increase my own personal happiness"

2. Generalize the maxim
"everyone will lie in order to increase their own personal happiness"

3. Search for contradiction
If this were the case, there would be no incentive to tell the truth. Truth telling would not exist, also making lies not exist either. 

4. Conclude
Thus, because the maxim contradicts itself by positing lies exist and by acknowledging lies would not exist if we treated everyone equally, the author of the maxim would act irrationally by lying, and thus wrongly.

#### Example 2: [[Suicide]]
Self directed, perfect duty
1. Develop a maxim:
"I will kill myself in order to end my suffering iff their suffering is mentally torturous"

2. Generalize the maxim
"everyone will kill themself in order to end their suffering iff their suffering is mentally torturous"

3. Search for contradiction
“Now we can see at once that a system of nature of which it should be a law to destroy life by means of the very feeling whose special nature it is to impel to the improvement of life would contradict itself, and therefore could not exist as a system of nature; hence that maxim cannot possibly exist as a universal law of nature, and consequently would be wholly inconsistent with the supreme principle of duty.” ([[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]] 89)

4. Conclude
One ought not kill themself

#### Example 3: Borrowing Money With No Intent on Returning It
Other directed, perfect duty

1. Develop a maxim:
"I will borrow money to repay my student loans without intending to return it in order to make my life easier"

2. Generalize the maxim
"Everyone will borrow money to repay their student loans without intending to return it in order to make their life easier"

3. Search for contradiction
If loaners knew that nobody intended on repaying their student debts, nobody would loan in the first place. This means that it is a rational contradiction to make an exception for yourself.

4. Conclude
One ought not take out a loan without intent to repay in order to make their life easier

## Tate's Formulation of [[Kant]]ian morals
P1) Humanity has the capacity of rationality.
P2) As a product of rationality, we all have our own ends.
P3) No human being has any intrinsic value over another.
C1) All humans have equal value and thus should be treated equally.
C2) All ends are equally important as any other.
C3) Thus any system which places any one end over another is unjust.
P4) In treating someone as a means to an end you violate C3.
C4) We must treat everyone as ends in themselves.
P5) If we act a certain way, that behavior, if beneficial, will be copied by rational actors.
P6) Behavior which violates C4, if beneficial to any individual, will be generalized to society as a whole.
C5) Act where at the same time we will it become a universal law.
P7) Failure to adhere to the prior principles at all times contradicts their nature, because laws aren't laws if they are broken at any time.
C6) We must act, at all times, as legislators in the kingdom of ends.
