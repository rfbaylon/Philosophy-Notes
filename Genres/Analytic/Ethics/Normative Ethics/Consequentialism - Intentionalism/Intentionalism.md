# Intentionalism
See [[Kant]]


Two senses of intentionality
- (intention) Done on purpose
- (intentionality) Done in pursuit of some end
	This distinction in phil of mind needs to be drawn out for moral intentionalism to have any meaningful pull.

## From Duty / With Duty
##### [[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]]
Duty is defined as "good will exposed to subjective limitations"

From Duty: The only maxim that can create moral good
In Accordance With Duty: Your action happens to be the right answer, but there was no good intention behind it

"For if any action is to be morally good, it is not enough that it should *conform* to the moral law - it must also be done *for the *sake* of the moral law*" [[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]], 57-58)
	Ex. A student guesses 69 as the answer to a math problem because it was funny, another does the calculations behind the mathematics and shows their work to arrive at an answer of 69. Once clearly acted from principles of mathematics, the other one happened to accord with the principles of mathematics.

## [[Kant]]'s Argument from Apriority of the Will
The will, and broadly morality, is a priori
Morality cannot be a posteriori
	Why, according to Kant, cant morality be a posteriori? #Questions
		"Kant thought the [[Categorical Imperative]] must be discovered _a priori_—through reason—because, as a fundamental moral law applying to all rational beings, it cannot be discovered through mere experience: one cannot learn how one _should_ act from how people _do_ act." ([Source](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-epistemology-a-priori/#AnalPrio))
			([[Hume]]'s guillotine -  see [[Moral Antirealism]])
Consequences are a posteriori
Therefore consequences have no moral weight as they are outside of the apriority of the moral law. 
[[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]], 75-77


## Ablism argument for Intentionalism
People with cognitive impairments (mentally disabled people, babies, league of legends players) ought not be held as morally accountable for their actions as people with money, knowledge, and power. 

## The Doctrine of Double Effect
See [[Catholicism]]
See [[Killing Vs. Letting Die]]
If an action has two effects, and the agent intends for one while considering the other as a side effect, the action is moral. 
For example, if an action is taken (Euthanizing someone) in order to reduce their pain, but it has the unwanted side effect of killing them, then it is OK because the unwanted side effect was not intended
	A2: By doing an action and understanding its consequences, you *clearly* intend all of the consequences that sprout from that action. This argument seems weaselly.
	A2: [[Singer]] If a company is polluting a river, but is only intending to increase efficiency, they are not then wiped of their moral blame when they say that pollution was just a side effect.
