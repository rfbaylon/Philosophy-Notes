### [[Nozick]]'s Experience Machine
#WIP: Need quote & detailed description + variants
[[Nozick]] has3 main reasons NOT to go into the experience machine. 
1. We want to do things. The experience of doing things is substantially different from actually doing them. By not doing them, we lose some value. An illusion is less valuable than the real thing.
	A2: [[Chalmers]]: virtual things are just as real as physical beings, as argued earlier in [[Reality+]]. The same goes for actions. Friends are made through VR, balls are thrown into hoops in VR, virtual bullets are shot into virtual persons in VR. These are all real actions ([[Reality+]], 314)
	A2: [[Chalmers]]: "What if it already turns out that we're already in a simulation? Do the earthing and swimming and kissing that we already do in our simulated environment have the value of sheer physicality or not? If so, then it starts to look like the issue isn't so much physicality verses virtuality as a preference for our original bodies and the environment we started in. If they do not: then why is simulation based reality any less valuable than quark based physical reality?" ([[Reality+]], 322)
2. We want to be things. If we want to be courageous or kind, we cannot do that in the machine. Programming yourself to be kind (eg) has different moral qualities than honing the skill of kindness
	A2: [[Chalmers]]: it seems like you could enter the experience machine in VR and this point would not stand. VR actions are not preprogrammed, so there is still autonomy. You would just be in a happier place. But you're still you. 
3. We want to be in contact with deeper reality. The natural world has deeper reality than the artificial.
	A2: [[Chalmers]]: Cities are manmade, yet we are still happy? Why?
	A2: [[Nature (Metaphysics)]] does not exist.
