## A2 Utilitarianism

### Demandingness Objection
#### AKA "Happiness Pump" 
See [[Wolf]]
If everyone were to be true utilitarians, nobody could do anything for themself. This includes buying a new computer, spending time with family, etc. There will always be a bigger issue that you are not solving by doing something for yourself
	A2: This applies to *every* ethical theory. A virtue ethicist will never be the perfect person, a Kantian will always have to help others complete their ends. Just because moral perfection is incredibly difficult to attain doesnt mean that the theory is wrong.
	A2: Even if there is what seems to many to be an incredibly high moral standard, that doesnt mean that the standard is wrong, it means the people judging it as 'too high' are wrong. Saying it is a high standard doesnt take down the reasons for accepting util, you just dont like the conclusion. 
	A2: Utilitarianism is attacked at both sides claiming that the theory is base and groveling  while at the same time setting too high of a standard for human nature ([[The Methods of Ethics]], 87)

### Util is a "doctrine of swine"
Utilitarianism results in believing that there are no higher pleasures. If eating ice cream or reading an academic paper bring the same amount of hedonistic joy, why choose one over the other?
#Cite actual objection from ancient Greeks
	A2: ([[J.S. Mill]]) There are higher and lower pleasures. The higher pleasures bring more joy and are more worth doing than eating a cone of ice cream. Higher pleasures include studying, reading, watching deep cinema, enjoying fine wines, etc #Cite 
		A2A2: Is this not classist? Is it not convenient that all of your so called higher pleasures are only enjoyed by aristocracy? 
		A2A2: ([[Bentham]]) If eating a cone of ice cream *truly* brought the same amount of joy as reading a philosophy paper, then they would be equal. But the original comparison isnt fair as ice cream is incredibly temporary, whereas philosophy brings joy over a much longer period of time.
		A2A2: If higher and lower pleasures are genuinely different *kinds* of things, how can you measure them against each other in moral calculations? Would they not have different units? If they have the same units but different quantities, how is your view different from [[Bentham]]?
	A2: ([[Bentham]]) "Quantity of pleasure being equal, push-pin is as good as poetry." If they both bring the same pleasure, they are both equal. If a pig *truly* gets the same amount of pleasure rolling in the mud that I do reading a philosophy paper, then they are both equal. Simple as
	A2: Why would it be bad to be as happy as a pig rolling in mud? This isnt immediately obvious. ([[Genres/Analytic/Ethics/Applied Ethics/Environmental Ethics/Veganism/Sentience Hierarchies]])
	A2: [[Sidgwick]] Utilitarianism is attacked at both sides claiming that the theory is base and groveling  while 
	at the same time setting too high of a standard for human nature ([[The Methods of Ethics]], 87)


### Utility Monster
If there were a being that could experience a happiness so great it outweighed every human being, it would follow from util that we ought to serve it in any way we can at the detriment of our own happiness
	A2: Biting the bullet isn't a horrible thing to do here. The above is true. 
	- Note that we are in a similar situation now given [[Longtermism]], and many people dedicate their lives to serving this utility monster.	

### Measuring Problem
Since you cannot measure the amount of pain added to the world when someone does an action, you cannot tell if it is a bad action or not. Thus, utilitarian which makes claims based on measurable good must be rejected
1.  Pain is unobjective (cannot be measured)
2.  Any system which claims to measure ‘bad-ness’ based off of a measure of pain is incomprehensible
3.  Utilitarianism is a system which claims to measure ‘bad-ness’ based off of a measure of pain
4.  Ergo, utilitarianism is incomprehensible  
	A2: #MyArgument :
		Reject 3. Instead, rephrase it as such
		"3. Consequentialist-utilitarianism is a system which claims to measure ‘bad-ness’ based off of a measure of pain"
		Not all utilitarianism claims to measure the bad-ness of an action based on the net utility added into the world, more specifically psychological-utilitarianism that bases the morality of an action based on the intended harm of an action.
		The issue with measutring pain is that it is impossible for one person to measure another person’s pain levels, leaving behind any hope for a consequentialist-utilitarian system as the aforementioned argument has laid out. 
		With a new lens, the problem for a pain/pleasure based moral system fades away. With a psychological-utilitarian lens, one can measure the immorality of an action in self reference, keeping objective consistency. 
			“When I enacted action X, I understood it to, and thus intended it to, cause pain to others synonymous with the pain I would undergo under situation Y”
			Thus, the more pain the subject would expect to feel under situation Y, the more immoral the action is. 
		Thus, because there is no 3rd party analyzing the “objective pain” of a situation, the measuring of immorality with pain is still tenable as it is only understandable in self reference. Because pain of action X and pain of situation Y are “like terms” they are objectively comparable to one another (able to be objectively compared, measured, and valued through the same (albeit subjective) lens of the individual) so they can create objectively true statements of morality based off of pain.
	A2: Materialism (metaphysics) strategy: Reject 1. Pain is caused by physical, objective phenomena and the levels of sensation of pain can be measured empirically. (See [[Hard Problem of Consciousness]]
	A2: [[J.S. Mill]]'s strategy. Rate an experience based on how good it is (on a scale from 1-100) per person, multiply it by chance of occurring. 
		If event A brings 25 'utils' for 4 people and has a 50% chance of occurring, it has a utility score of 50
			(25 x 4 x 50% = 50)
			QALYs (Quality Adjusted Life Years) use a similar calculation (See [[List of best charities]])
	A2: *Every* ethical system has to deal with this issue. The [[Categorical Imperative]] has to weigh other's ends against one another, [[Virtue Ethics]] has to figure out the best way to bring about human perfection through helping others happy and successful. This issue isnt unique to Utilitarianism. Hell, economics, psychology, sociology, politics, and many *many* other fields rely on subjective data such as a 'happiness rating'
