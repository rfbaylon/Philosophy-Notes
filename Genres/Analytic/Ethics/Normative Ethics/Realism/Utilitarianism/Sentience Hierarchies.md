In other words, what makes the difference between killing a mouse and a human being? How do we compare value of different lives?

# There is no Hierarchy
## Sentience Hierarchy Denial
"A mouse and a human are both equally intrinsically valuable"

### Argument from Speciesism
How exactly do we measure "sentience" any way? is it not rather convenient that the beings at the top of the sentience hierarchy are the ones most similar to humans?

### Argument from Relativism of Pleasure / Pain
All pain and pleasure is relative to other experiences. 
	"The pleasures of a mouse's life are all that the mouse has, and are as important to the mouse as the pleasures of studying philosophy are to the most enthusiastic student of the subject" ([[Practical Ethics]], 90)

### Rejection of [[J.S. Mill]]'s Hierarchy Leads to No Hierarchy
[[J.S. Mill]]: There are higher and lower pleasures
[[Bentham]]: "Quantity of pleasure being equal, push-pin is as good as poetry" #Quote #Cite
	[[Singer]] and [[Sidgwick]] ([[The Methods of Ethics]] 109) agree

# There is a Hierarchy
## Gradations of *Intellect* create Value Distinctions

## Gradations of *Sensitivity* create Value Distinctions

## Gradations of *Rationality* create Value Distinctions
