## Summary

Care ethics involves progressing past the androcentric model of ethics that relies on principles, rules, dispassionate obedience, individualism, impersonality, and abstraction. 

Instead of these masculine traits, care ethics wants to focus on developing a more feminine ethic that is contextual, compassionate, relational, communitarian, and responsive.

## The Empirics
In psychological moral development, boys tended towards hierarchical and rule based reasoning for moral actions. Doing things because it is ones duty or because it followed the law were the frequent reasons. When studying moral development in girls, the reasoning tended towards connection, relationships, nonviolence, and collaboration. 

## Traditional Theory Failure

### Context Blindness
#### Or, Narrative Truncation
See [[Gruen]]
Traditional views in [[Deontology]] or [[Utilitarianism]] rip situations from their broader contexts meaning that a lot of crucial context is missing from particular situations
[[Singer]]'s child in a pond analogy is a good example of this. There is only a consideration of the child present, but no discussion of how the child got there or even if it was you that pushed them into the pond! Standard ethical arguments rip a problem out of its embedded context, resulting in brute decision making that lacks nuance. Relationships, context, and environment shape the situations we find ourselves in, but the traditional theories down play their importance by entirely ignoring them.

This type of argumentation also sets up a binary in which there is a hero  and a victim, which could obscure the fact that the hero may be a part of the larger problem. 

### Alienation
See [[Gruen]]
The inner life of the shopper (as viewed by traditional economists) as well as the inner life of the agent (as viewed by traditional moral philosophers) is parasitic on his outward behaviors. The inner life in both cases remains, at best, besides the point. This alienates shoppers and moral decision makers. 

### Character Matters
[[Singer]]'s style of argumentation doesnt recognize at all the emotions, sensitivities, sympathie, interests, worries, etc of the people actually making moral decisions. Nor, does the detatched ethic of [[Utilitarianism]] account for the experiences of those in need.

## Ecofeminism

### Entangled Empathy
See [[Gruen]] , [[Entangled Empathy]]

"A type of caring perception focused on attending to another's experience of wellbeing. An experiential process that involves a blend of emotion and cognition by which we recognize we are in relationships with others and are called upon to be responsive and responsible in these relationships by attending to another's needs, interest, desires, vulnerabilities, hopes, and sensitivities" [[Entangled Empathy]], 3

### Speciesism
[[Singer]] and [[Regan]]'s approach to animal ethics depends on sameness via the [[Name That Trait]] argument, arguing that because animals share our capacities in some way, we ought to care about them. Sameness should not be the metric by which we count individuals. Instead, it should be based on the relations we have with others.
