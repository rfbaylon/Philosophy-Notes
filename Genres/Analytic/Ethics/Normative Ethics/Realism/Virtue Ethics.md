## General Arguments for VE

### Moral Uncodifiability Argument
Morality cannot be codified as per [[GÃ¶del's Incompleteness Theorem]].
	A2: #MyArgument for the codifiability of VE: Because there are finite possible actions that humans can do (as humans are finite beings), all moral action is a limited set. Thus, although it would be impractical to codify virtue ethics, it would be possible. Thus even under VE, what one ought to do is codifiable (logically able to be codified).
