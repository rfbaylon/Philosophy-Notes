## General Arguments for VE

### Moral Uncodifiability Argument

# A2 Virtue Ethics

### VE is Agent Based, not Action Based
Morality ought to tell me what actions I ought to do, not what kind of person I ought to be. Thus, it doesnt seem like VE can really be considered moral theory in the same way that [[Utilitarianism]] or following [[Categorical Imperative]] can be
	A2: [[Hursthouse]]: What actions one ought to do is of the concern of Virtue Ethicists, just one level deeper. While VE focuses on what kind of person one ought to become, the crucial part of that becoming is doing the actions that the kind of person one ought to be does. ([[On Virtue Ethics]], 27)
	A2: [[Hursthouse]]: This same critique could be made of Act [[Utilitarianism]] or [[Kant]]ian Ethics (EG "An action is right iff it is in accordance with a correct moral rule or principle.")

### Circularity
The statement "Some thing (x) is virtuous iff a virtuous person would do x." is circular! It tells me nothing about how to be a virtuous person. 
	A2: [[Hursthouse]]: Putting the central tenet incredibly obviously, there is no circularity. At *least* it is as circular as other normative theories.
		P1. An action is right iff it is what an X agent would characteristically do in the circumstances, and 
		P.1a. An X agent is one who has and exercises certain character traits, namely the Xs.
		([[On Virtue Ethics]], 30)

### How do I learn how to learn to be virtuous??
"But virtue ethics yields only the prescription, 'Do what the virtuous agent-the one who is just, honest, charitable etc.-would do in these circumstances.' And this gives me no guidance unless I am (and know I am) a virtuous If agent myself-in which case I am hardly in need of it. I am less than fully virtuous, I shall have no idea what a virtuous agent would do, and hence cannot apply the only prescription virtue ethics has given me." ([[On Virtue Ethics]] 35)
	A2: [[Hursthouse]]: it is fully possible to ask a virtuous person what they would do; and we do this frequently when we choose who to go to for advice. ([[On Virtue Ethics]] 35)
	A2: [[Hursthouse]]: If we understand honesty to be an example of a virtue, could one not understand 'be more honest' as something to strive for, even if imperfect themselves? ([[On Virtue Ethics]] 36)

### Virtue Ethics is Uncodifiable
The task of normative ethics is to come up with a set of universal rules that could create a decision procedure and explicit. Virtue ethics shrugs both of these concerns, thus making it a bad normative theory. 
Building on this, if VE is truly uncodifiable, there will be no decision procedure for individuials. there is no way to rank values 
A2: [[Hursthouse]]: The project of creating a codifiable ethic has largely failed, there are no theories that give a substantiative ranked set of principles.
A2: Morality cannot be codified as per [[GÃ¶del's Incompleteness Theorem]].
	A2A2: #MyArgument for the codifiability of VE: Because there are finite possible actions that humans can do (as humans are finite beings), all moral action is a limited set. Thus, although it would be impractical to codify virtue ethics, it would be possible. Thus even under VE, what one ought to do is codifiable (logically able to be codified).

### The Conflict Problem
Tragic dilemmas, situations from which, perforce, the agent emerges with dirty hands, are situations in which the supposedly charitable, honest, just ... agent is forced to act callously, dishonestly, unjustly ... But if someone acts callously or dis honestly... , she cannot be charitable or honest ... ; that would be a contradiction. So, if there are tragic dilemmas then no one can really be charitable or honest or ... ; no one can really have those character traits. There cannot be such a thing as a virtuous agent.
	A2: [[Hursthouse]]: The virtous agent in such a situation does NOT act viciously, that is, as a viscious person would. They act with immense regret, pain, and empathy. The virtous agent does not act badly in these situations. In other words, they acted the best they could for this situation.
