What exactly *is* meaning in relation to language?


# Meaning as Use
See [[Wittgenstein]], [[Derrida]]
Meaning is split into verbal and ostensive definitions
	Verbal: Defines a word relationally, like a dictionary. When defining a word, you point to other words
	Ostensive: Defining an object in relation to signs (pointing at a tree and saying "this is a tree")
		This pointing could refer to the trunk, this specific type of tree, all things with leaves, all things in earth, etc in the eyes of the learner.

We come to understand the meaning of the word *solely* through some ostensive definition. This can happen in two ways.
	1. Teaching meaning is a drill. 
		this drill associates all past usages of the word "yellow" to yellow things
	2. Teaching meaning is rule based
		When asked to paint a red patch with a reference sample, one can post-hoc reason their way to action
			A is "red"
			B needs to be the same color as A
			B needs to be "red"
				This interaction proves a cause for painting B "red", not a reason for doing so. This means that we never learn language through strict rules, but always through habit of ostensive definitions. 

- There are finite signs, but infinite sign-interpretations.

Philosophy is finding a large sum of books spread 'higgledy-piggledy' on the floor and finding the best way to organize them on a bookshelf. Over time, different epistemes and different people organize them differently based on certain resemblances to other books, but in the end, there is no *final* organization of books. 

The most notable example to convey Wittgenstein's point here is the word "can" When someone says they "can" do something, they mean a million different things depending on teh context tehya rise in. Is it metaphysically possible? Physically possible? Logically possible? Biologically possible? The sign changes meaning depening on its use in context of a broader language game. 
	"The thing to do in such cases is always to look how the words in question *are actually used in our language*" ([[The Blue and Brown Books]], 56)
"Do we use a hammer in two different ways when we hit a nail with it and, on the other hand, drive a peg into a hole? And do we use it in two different ways or in the same way when we drive this peg into a hole and, on the other hand drive another peg into a different hole? Or should we only call it different uses when in one case we drive something into something and in the other, say, we smash something? Or is this all using the hammer in one way and is it to be called a different way when we use the hammer in a paper weight?" [[The Blue and Brown Books]], 58

Likewise, Chess rules are *only* comprehensible in Chess-Game

"The sign gets its significance from the system of signs, from the language to which it belongs (AKA Language Game)"
	[[The Blue and Brown Books]], 5
"The idea that in order to get clear about the meaning of a general term one had to find the common element in all its applications has shackled philosophical investigation"
	[[The Blue and Brown Books]], 19
"To suppose that there must be (strict rules to language) would be like supposing that whenever children play with a ball they play a game according to strict rules."
	[[The Blue and Brown Books]], 25
"Every sign is capable of interpretation; but the *meaning* mustnt be capable of interpretation. It is the last interpretation."
	[[The Blue and Brown Books]], 34
"I want to play chess, and a man gives the king a paper crown, laving the use of the piece unaltered, but telling me that the crown has a meaning to him in the game, which he cant express with rules. I say: "as long as it doesnt alter the use of the piece, it hasnt what I call a 'meaning"'"
	[[The Blue and Brown Books]], 65
"Think of words as instruments characterized by their use"
	[[The Blue and Brown Books]], 67


Act of language split into two parts as well: organic and inorganic
	Organic: understanding, interpreting, and creating meaning out of signs
	Inorganic: The handling of signs (the act of communicating)

Generalities are
	A) Something common between objects to subsume them into a label
	B) Prototypical schemas for categories
	C) Confusion between thinking and emotional states
	D) Science reducing the world into as few fundamental laws as possible
