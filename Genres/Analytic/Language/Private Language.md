See [[Wittgenstein]]

### Definition:
A language that only one person speaks

# Arguments Against Existence:

1. We can only learn language through other people
2. For language to exist, it needs one other person
3. Language is the communication of concepts
	If i have the idea of an island in my mind, the way I put that image into your mind is by uttering "island" and hoping that you have the same image in your brain when I utter it. 
	
	"If I wish to explain to someone who does not know Greek the simple impression that a line of Home leaves upon me, I shall give the translation of the line,  then comment on my translation, then I shall develop my commentary, and from explanation to explanation I shall get closer to what I wish to express; but I shall never quite reach it."
