# Signifier / Signified

Signifier: The strring of symbols used to communicate the idea of the signified
	E.g., the string of letters t, r, e, e to form the word "tree"
	The *syntactic* meaning of a word
Signified: The referent of the signifier, the thing in itself
	E.g., the actual bushy, trunked thing that we call a "tree"
	The *semantic* meaning of a word

- Every signifier has a signified (otherwise it becomes part of a [[private language]]). Not all things have a signifier though.

## Sign
The set of both a signifier and a signified is a sign, or the smallest unit of meaning.
	The conjunction of "tree" and tree is a sign.
