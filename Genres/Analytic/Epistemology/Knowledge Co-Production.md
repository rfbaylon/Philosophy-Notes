Co-produced knowledge is a process by which science is made using heavy input from a community, not merely as subjects of an experiment, but as researchers, designing, executing, and collaborating on the important values underlying the scientific process. This process is opposed to the traditional technocratic science that has traditionally educated scientists designing, executing, and deciding the values of the experiments they conduct.

# Technocratic Science

## Technocratic Science

### Argument from Expertise
Experts are experts for a reason - they just know the most about the things they are experts on. If we were to ask the question of how to best outwit an opponent in chess, the better option is obviously to talk to a Grand Master over a rookie, just because they have the experience to back up their knowledge and advice.

### Argument from Stability
Someone who has only heard a topic tossed around rather than seriously debated are far more susceptible to misinformation than the average expert who has sat with the data for years, or perhaps decades. Because experts have much more ability to sift through malicious misinformation, they should have more of a say in science related discussions than laypeople. In a few words, scientists are more objective than the lay population.

## A2 Technocratic Science

### Scientism hurts democracy
Scientism is the belief that science has all of the answers; but this idea puts far too much weight into our current thinking. People, including scientists, believe that history has been a series of mistakes, but finally now we have an objective answer. This idea seems far too naïve and massively overstates the claims of science. Promoting expert knowledge over civilian knowledge bolsters scientism and will lead to horrible consequences we can't see right now because we can only look through the lens of the present. The best way as of now to prevent these overstatements of science is to much more heavily include publics within science and democratize the process away from technocrats.

### Case Study: Gene Editing
See [[Human Gene Editing]]

#### CRISPR Projects that Happen are Those With Funding
All science relies on funding of some sort, but it just so happens that for research in the biomedical field, the only things that get funding are those that will bring a product to market, as that is pretty much the only way for the investors to get money back. Thus, the interests going into CRISPR are not concerned about the common good, but just that which will make substantial money from investors with a lot to gain. From this, important topics such as biosecurity go completely underfunded. Currently, we cannot trust the experts to make value judgements about their research as their projects are driven by profit. There needs to be substantially more research in safety before any more large projects appear.

#### Nobody Knows Anything in the Squo
The fact that 42% of Americans have not even heard of CRISPR shows that there are still milestones to reach in terms of public information. This is not a subject that a lot of people know about and there are just debates as to the values behind it, it is a subject that the broad American public are clueless about. It would be incredibly antidemocratic and highly authoritarian to slip some science with monumental implications behind the backs of the people without them even hearing about it in the first place. The people at least deserve a chance to debate it.

### Case Study: Sheepfarming After Chernobyl
Brian Wynne, a scientist turned into a scientific sociologist, focuses his research on the technocratic failure of the top down approach of the English Government after Chernobyl. After the radioactive fallout befell the Lake District in Northern England, technocratic government researchers told sheep farmers that their sheep would be safe. They did this without consulting any of the local knowledge holders, and as a result completely misunderstood the sheep market. In the end, the continued radiation and the ignorance on the part of the technocrats led the sheep to be near worthless at market. Technocrats believed that they knew better than the local experts, leading to a catastrophe for the locals and disintegrating trust between rural Northern Englanders and scientific institutions. (Wynne, 1989)

# Co-Produced Science

## Co-produced Science

### Publicly Produced Science is Better
According to a few studies, science that is made in a democratic fashion (IE, co produced science without ‘experts’) produces substantially better science. An example is in a Maine fishery that had a government produced study on population levels of a certain type of fish that was inadequate according to many of the local anglers. Together with a local college, they produced a new study that was seen as substantially better than the original expert made one. A metaanalysis backs up this case study showing repeated success of co-produced knowledge.

### Coproduction Bolsters Democracy
Science is commonly just seen to describe how the world is. It claims to merely describe the properties of gravity, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, or the count of a certain species in a forest. This is only half of the story though; science also by its very nature makes normative claims by choosing which research is valuable, which questions are worth asking, and manufacturing the ‘best’ way to go about knowledge production. As a result, the products of a normative methodology are also normative. Because values that impact all people ought to be decided, at least partially, by the people, a democratization of science is necessary to achieve not only epistemic justice, but moral justice.

## A2 Coproduced Science

### Question of Cost
By their nature, co-produced studies are going to be more expensive than traditional technocratic science. How much more costly? Will this rise in cost be prohibitive for certain types of already underfunded science?
	Cooke, S. J., Nguyen, V. M., Chapman, J. M., Reid, A. J., Landsman, S. J., Young, N., Hinch, S. G., Schott, S., Mandrak, N. E., & Semeniuk, C. A. D. (2020). Knowledge co‐production: A pathway to effective fisheries management, conservation, and governance. Fisheries, 46(2), 89–97. https://doi.org/10.1002/fsh.10512 

### Question of Quality Improvement
Some studies say that co-produced studies are widely considered better science than non co-produced studies, but the uncertainty lies in how much better. If it is the case that technocratic studies are worse, but still lead to good conclusions with decent reasoning, then it could just not be worth the cost and time tradeoff of co-produced studies.

### Question of Participation
For many projects like that of co-production, the process relies on intense participation from the public and non-interested reporting. There is a looming question about how a democratic science would work for many projects that are either really boring or repulsive to the general population but still incredibly important to do. The uncertainty lies in A) how do we make sure that we have people eager to do science and B) how do we make sure that people are doing their part in the best way possible.
