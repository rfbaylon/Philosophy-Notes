## Rationalism
See [[Spinoza]], [[Leibniz]], [[Descartes]]

### [[Leibniz]]' Argument from Mental Acausality
The only thing that separates man from animal is the capacity for innate ideas such as logic.

Since substances are acausal and aeffectual (as per [[Substance Pluralism]]), we cannot learn anything from other substances directly. The only thing that can happen is that subconscious, laden knowledge can be *unlocked* from the potential it was in the soul. Leibniz himself says this argument is reminiscent of [[Plato]]'s argument for [[Abstract Objects]].  [[Discourse on Metaphysics]] XXVI
	Expressions in souls (whether or not they are apprehended) are called 'ideas'
		Apprehended ideas are called 'notions'
		ALL Adequate ideas are within both God AND souls, the distinction is that God *apprehends* all ideas.
	For an example, he uses [[Socrates]]' conversation with a slave boy, teaching him geometry without "experiencing" anything new
		A2: [[Locke]] if this is true, then what unlocks the knowledge if not empirical experience?


## A2 Rationalism
See [[Bergson]]

### [[Bergson]] on Rationalism's Failure to Unite the Ego
Rationalism takes psychological states to be a set of fragments attached via the Ego. But because it mistakes that an object is more than the sum of its parts. In the end, rationalism, like empericism, can only define the unity of the person negatively.
	Rationalism, holding the nexus of of all psychological states in the ego, meaning that the person becomes infinite and central. It expands towards infinity. 

# Empiricism

## Empiricism
See [[Hume]], [[Locke]], [[Berkeley]], [[J.S. Mill]], [[Whitehead]]

## A2 Empiricism
See [[Bergson]]

### Empiricism focuses too much on the translation
[[Bergson]]: "(Empiricism) consists in seeking the original in the translation where it naturally cannot be, and in denying the original on the plea that one does not find it in the translation. It necessarily ends in negations" [[Introduction to Metaphysics]], 30

### [[Bergson]] on Rationalism's Failure to Unite the Ego
Empericism takes psychological states to be a set of fragments attached via the Ego. But because it mistakes that an object is more than the sum of its parts. In the end, rationalism, like empiricism, can only define the unity of the person negatively.
	 Empiricism fills in the obvious gaps with interpolations of what could exist in making a person ad infinitum, making the confined individual contract towards Zero the further one pushes.
	 "Either there is no philosophy possible and all knowledge is practical knowledge turned to the profit to be gained from them (empiricism), or philosophizing consists in placing oneself within the object itself by an effort of intuition." ([[Bergson]] clearly prefers the latter) ([[Introduction to Metaphysics]], 39).
