### Leibniz

The only thing that separates man from animal is the capacity for innate ideas such as logic.

### [[Leibniz]]' Argument from Mental Acausality
Since substances are acausal and aeffectual (as per [[Substance Pluralism]]), we cannot learn anything from other substances directly. The only thing that can happen is that subconscious, laden knowledge can be *unlocked* from the potential it was in the soul. Leibniz himself says this argument is reminiscent of [[Plato]]'s argument for [[Abstract Objects]].  [[Discourse on Metaphysics]] XXVI
	Expressions in souls (whether or not they are apprehended) are called 'ideas'
		Apprehended ideas are called 'notions'
		ALL Adequate ideas are within both God AND souls, the distinction is that God *apprehends* all ideas.
	For an example, he uses [[Socrates]]' conversation with a slave boy, teaching him geometry without "experiencing" anything new
		A2: [[Locke]] if this is true, then what unlocks the knowledge if not empirical experience?


# A2 Rationalism
See [[Empiricism]], [[Bergson]]

### [[Bergson]] on Rationalism's Failure to Unite the Ego
Rationalism takes psychological states to be a set of fragments attached via the Ego. But because it mistakes that an object is more than the sum of its parts. In the end, rationalism, like [[Empiricism]], can only define the unity of the person negatively.
	Rationalism, holding the nexus of of all psychological states in the ego, meaning that the person becomes infinite and central. It expands towards infinity.
