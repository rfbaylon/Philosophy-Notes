# A2 Empiricism
See [[Rationalism]], [[Bergson]]

### Empiricism focuses too much on the translation
[[Bergson]]: "(Empiricism) consists in seeking the original in the translation where it naturally cannot be, and in denying the original on the plea that one does not find it in the translation. It necessarily ends in negations" [[Introduction to Metaphysics]], 30

### [[Bergson]] on Rationalism's Failure to Unite the Ego
Empericism takes psychological states to be a set of fragments attached via the Ego. But because it mistakes that an object is more than the sum of its parts. In the end, rationalism, like [[Rationalism]], can only define the unity of the person negatively.
	 Empiricism fills in the obvious gaps with interpolations of what could exist in making a person ad infinitum, making the confined individual contract towards Zero the further one pushes.
	 "Either there is no philosophy possible and all knowledge is practical knowledge turned to the profit to be gained from them (empiricism), or philosophizing consists in placing oneself within the object itself by an effort of intuition." ([[Bergson]] clearly prefers the latter) ([[Introduction to Metaphysics]], 39).
