## Bacon
[[Bacon]]'s goal has always been to find the necessary and suffecient confitions

1. After this, he will gather data from a posteriori experience about all things sharing a common trait. 
2. Find the common trait between them that can explain the property in each thing

Find things with heat (fire, poop, animals, meat, metal in the sun, etc)
all of these things move, so therefore, all heat comes from motion.

## Mill
[[J.S. Mill]]

1. Method of difference
	Find the difference between two different variables, and measure changes in one compared to changes in the other
		This is basically the discovery of independent and dependent variables


## Whewell
[[Whewell]]
Critiqued Bacon and Mill claiming that there can be no codifiable method by which we can discover things, the thing that is crucial for discovery is the human creativity.  

Scientific discovery requires
meaningful observation requires inventing relevant categories
	Scientific observation requires concept construction
meaningful data collection is guided and constrained
	by what we take to be the relevant question
	by what we take to be relevant to our tentative answers


### A2: BACON
Bacon, designed by Langley et al, is a computer system based on a weak algorithm which claims to create scientific discoveries based on heuristics and 
	"BACON exhibits a set of processes when executed actually make scientific discoveries" ; BACON specifically found the inverse square law by connecting data, similar to how Kepler discovered it. BACON did the same with Maxwell's law and Faraday's law. 
		A2: Whewell: Scientific discovery requires *concepts* not just computation of raw data. Machines cannot use concepts so thus machines cannot make any discoveries. Inputting the specific data into BACON (that BACON would not have otherwise) is incredibly crucial to the scientific process; and its unique to humans.
