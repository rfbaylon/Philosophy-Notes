How do we decide which side effects are relevant to a task? \
How is it possible for me to make a midnight snack and understand which information is relevant for me to do so? How can I do such a thing without running billions of lines of mental code? 

Frame Axiom: If x is blue before, and I move x onto y, then x is blue after
	This can be reformulated for all colors and actions that could possibly be applied to x.

Three missionaries and three cannibals come to a river. A rowboat that seats two is available. If the cannibals ever outnumber the missionaries on either bank of the river, the missionaries will be eaten. How shall they cross the river? Obviously the puzzler is expected to devise a strategy of rowing the boat back and forth that gets them all across and avoids disaster ...
Imagine giving someone the problem, and after he puzzles for awhile, he suggests going upstream half a mile and crossing on a bridge. 'What bridge?' you say. 'No bridge is mentioned in the statement of the problem.' And this dunce replies, 'Well, they don't say there isn't a bridge.' You look at the English and even at the translation of the English into first order logic, and you must admit that 'they don't say' there is no bridge. So you modify the problem to exclude bridges and pose it again, and the dunce proposes a helicopter, and after you exclude that, he proposes a winged horse or that the others hang onto the outside of the boat while two row. 
You now see that while a dunce, he is an inventive dunce. Despairing of getting him to accept the problem in the proper puzzler's spirit, you tell him the solution. To your further annoyance, he attacks your solution on the grounds that the boat might have a leak or lack oars. After you rectify that omission from the statement of the problem, he suggests that a sea monster may swim up the river and may swallow the boat. Again you are frustrated, and you look for a mode of reasoning that will settle his hash once and for all. (McCarthy 1980: 29-30)

Why dont children steal cookies from a cookie jar? "Well, the idea of cookie-reaching becomes connected by a habit path to the idea of spanking, which in turn is connected to the idea of pain ... so of course the child refrains." [[Cogntitive Wheels 2006]], 132
