## The Author's Intention

## The Eye of the Beholder
See [[Barthes]], [[Foucault]]

### [[Barthes]]' Anthropological Argument
In Non-European cultures, there was never an author, only an interpreter of a story
	"In ethnographic societies, narrative is never assumed by a person but by a mediator, shaman, or reciter, whose "performance" (i.e., his mastery of the narrative code) can be admired, but never his "genius." The author is a modern character, no doubt produced by our society as it emerged from the Middle Ages"

### [[Barthes]]' Argument from Pluralism
All writing is not a single message divined from the 'author' but instead consists of a multi-dimensional space in which are marries and contested several writings. There is no such thing as original artwork, only syntheses of previous works.
	"We know now that a text consists not of a line of words, releasing a single "theological" meaning (the "message" of the Author-God), but of a multi-dimensional space in which are married and contested several writings, none of which is original:=: the text is a fabric of quotations."

### [[Barthes]]' Argument from Limiting Text
To limit a work to merely what the author believes is to kill it. It is to allow it to have a final 'solution' that misses so much larger context such as culture, language, and unconscious psyche.
	"To assign an Author to a text is to impose a brake on it, to furnish it with a final signified, to close writing. This conception is quite suited to criticism, which then undertakes the important task of discovering the Author (or his hypostases: society, history, the psyche, freedom)"
		 [[The Death of the Author]], 53
	"We know that in order to restore writing to its future, we must reverse the myth: the birth of the reader must be requited by the death of the Author."
