# Split Self

There are multiple selves in a person, a moral self, a narrative self
There are "five distinct but functionally complementary
dimensions: ecological, intersubjective, conceptual, private, and temporally extended." (Tekin, 2018)

## Split Self

### Argument from Scientific Backing
All of the selves are scientifically scrutable and quantifiable, meaning that there is some sort of weight to the concept of different selves. Science also talks about different selves in differing contexts, where a physician and a psychiatrist might both be talking about how to improve your "self," but mean different things. 
(Tekin, 2018)

# The Self as Use

The self means differing things depending on the usage within the context it is written or spoken

## The Self as Use

### The [[Wittgenstein]]ian Argument
All words get their meaning from their use in context. The self when a moral pholosopher is talking about it refers to the agent, the self when a psychiatrist talks about it is talking about the mental dispositions and actions of a person, the self when an average person is talking about it might be talking about the narrative that person makes for themself. There is no right answer, no platonic form of the self, it just depends on usage.

# Self Nihilism

There are no coherent and universal notions of what a self is, therefore there is not "problem of the self." 

## Self Nihilism

### The Negative Argument
There is no universal, quantifiable, and coherent notion of what a self is. Because I just dont understand what the word could mean, there doesnt seem to be any problem. The problem of the self is a problem precisely because it is manufactured by the vagueness of the term itself.  (Olson, 1998)
	A2: Without the concept of a self, how can moral responsibility exist, and how can we differentiate the person that I am from the person that others are? The word clearly has some utility.
	A2: [[Wittgenstein]]: This arguments seems perhaps intentionally obtuse. Even if there is no universal definition of what a chair is that includes all chairs but discludes all not-chairs, that doesn't mean that chairs don't exist.
