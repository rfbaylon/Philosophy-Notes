Is the removal of future pleasure actually bad?
-   If I am going to give my friend a gift, and then later decide not to for an arbitrary reason, would I be wronging them?

## Prudential Desire

Prudential reasons come from satisfying present desires
"Future interests are important to me in so far as I have present desires to be happy in the future"
See [[Epicurus]], [[Singer]]
This view holds two assumptions that are important to note:
1. Desire can *only* provide reason when that desire is present
2. any desire with a future object provides reason for pursuing that object
	A2: [[Nagel]] 1: This essentially means that expectation of a future reason cannot provide any reason for present action.
		(If I want to do well on the SAT, it doesn't follow that I ought to study right now)
	A2: [[Nagel]] 2: This also conversely means that any present desire for a future object to provide reason for present action. In other words, there is no way to distinguish whims from important future events. This can also be taken a step farther to say that if there is a desire for a future that i expect will not exist in the future, there will still be reason for me to act on it.3
		(If a 5 year old tells his mom he wants to be a rockstar, then that provides present reason for this kid to pick up guitar to practice)
		"If on Monday, I expect that on Tuesday I shall want to eat a pear on Wednesday, although I also expect that on Wednesday I shall be indifferent to pears, then on Monday I have clear prudential reasons to make sure I have a pear available on Wednesday, although I will not have any reason to want it then." [[The Possibility of Altruism]], 42
	A2: [[Nagel]]: "A person's future should be of interest to hum not because it is among his present interests, but because it is *his future*." [[The Possibility of Altruism]], 42


## Prudential Reason

### [[Nagel]]'s Argument from Temporal Independence of Reason
By grounding reason in prudence, it allows us to make general maxims by which morality (or even just action) may rest. For example, if it were true that Maxwell has reason to obey the law, it would follow that Maxwell has reason to obey the law in all situations like the one he is in currently. By adopting this framework, it allows us to make temporally independent actions.
	"Prudential reasons arise, in short, because if it is tenselessly true that a reason-predicate applies independently to a certain event-present or future- then there is prima facie reason to promote it."" [[The Possibility of Altruism]], 49
	A2: But it could be true people that have a reason to do something don't do that thing
		A2A2: This is true, but it doesn't harm the theory. There can be other motivating factors such as cowardice, weakness, etc that impair ones ability to do that which they have reason for, but that doesn't mean they have reason to act in the first place ([[The Possibility of Altruism]], 66)

### [[Nagel]]'s Argument from Regret
Only with a view of prudential reason can it make sense for regret to exist. You can only want something to have happened if there were reasons for it to have happened in the past. Because the past individual (and thus past desires) dont exist anymore, it cant make sense for the phenomena of regret to exist. [[The Possibility of Altruism]], 72

Consequences:
- Thus, means are *causal* pathways towards ends. It is not arbitrary
- Even if nobody believes there is a reason to promote an end, there is still reason to promote that end.
- People, no matter whether they are future or present, are equally morally considerable
	- 	"It is the condition that a person be equally real at all stages of his life; specifically, the fact that a particular stage is *present* cannot be regarded as conferring on it any special status" [[The Possibility of Altruism]], 60
	- "The present is just a time among others, and confers no special status on the circumstances which occupy it" [[The Possibility of Altruism]], 61
