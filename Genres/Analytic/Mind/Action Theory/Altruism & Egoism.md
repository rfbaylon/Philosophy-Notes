# Altruism
See [[Nagel]], [[Singer]], 

Altruism is: willingness to act in consideration of the interests of other beings, without the need of ulterior motives
Altruism requires not just that you see yourself as just yourself, but as *someone*
	"when one can secure or promote such an end for someone else, and either a) there are no conflicting reasons, or b) all other considerations balance out, then one has sufficient reason to act." [[The Possibility of Altruism]] 128

### [[Nagel]]'s Negative Argument Against [[Egoism (Action Theory)]]
Egoism is predicated upon this:
	I will help another person IFF
		1. by helping them, they will be more likely to help me in the future
		2. The thought of myself in their position brings about a vivid emotional disgust
Nagel argues that there are cases where neither of these are true, but people still act altruistically towards others
	See [[Longtermism]], as there is no emotional connection to people who don't exist, and future people will never help me in return.
	Why cant an individual increase their security in order to protect against violence against them self or drug themself such that they will not have an emotional response? These things could easily produce more good for yourself. ([[The Possibility of Altruism]], 82-83)

### [[Nagel]]'s Positive Parallel Argument
If you take Nagel's argument in the [[Prudence]] note to be sound, you ought to also consider the argument for altruism as sound.
Just like timeless reasons retain motivational content despite the time they occur, only objective reasons ([[Types of Reason]]) can carry motivational content despite the person they occur to.
	"Ethics is a struggle against a certain form of the ego-centric predicament, just as prudential reasoning is a struggle against domination of the present" [[The Possibility of Altruism]], 100
	"The shift from wanting *that* to wanting *to* is as radical as the shift from expecting *that* to expecting *to*" ([[The Possibility of Altruism]], 122)

### The Intuitive Argument Against [[Egoism (Action Theory)]]
Nobody could actually live like an egoist as it would require
- answering the question "what is it to them?" when asking for help
- Someone stepping on someone elses swollen toes has no actual reason to stop
- It would make the person miserable
	A2: This is an actual strawman [[Fallacy]]. An egoist could easily incorporate these things into their theory and account for it by either appeals to emotion or future action. This is a bad argument. An egoist can still give to the poor (e.g.), but it would be for a different reason than the altruist would.

### The Argument from the Impersonal View
In saying "I should leave the building before the bomb goes off," you create a universal principle such that anyone in your situation ought to leave the building before the bomb goes off. Principles must be able to apply to people outside of oneself. This cannot be done with a practical principle taht applies only to oneself.
	An impersonal practical principle is "Ryan Baylon should do that which keeps her alive." This statement is distinct from "I should do that which keeps me alive." For being Ryan Baylon is not one of the relevant conditions in the derivation of personal practical principles. 
	In other words, whether or not I am Ryan Baylon or not doesnt change the reasons for getting out of a burning building.
	In other words, "For example, if someone has reason to avoid pain, that must be because pain—anyone’s pain—is to be avoided." [SEP](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/altruism/#NageImpeStan)

# Egoism
See [[Hobbes]], [[Hume]], [[CosmicSkeptic]]
See [[Moral Egoism]], [[Subjective Theory of Value]]

Since it is I that am acting, even when I act parallel to the interests of others, it must be an interest of mine that provides the impulse.

I will help another person IFF
	1. by helping them, they will be more likely to help me in the future
	2. The thought of myself in their position brings about a vivid emotional disgust

### Negative Argument from Competitive Examples
IN competitive sports, if you hold that all competing parties are equally interested (and thus equally valubale) it doesnt make sense for you to go into a boxing match and prefer yourself to win when your opponents interests are just as valuable.
	A2: [[Nagel]]: We have to ask why the match is here in teh first place. It is to provide a show for an audience, excersize the products of labour, and to earn a title for the boxers. By boxers helping eachother, they dont achieve any of these goals. The objective principle behind competition is for people to beat eachother up to create something best for both parties in its synthesis.

### Negative Argument from Private Examples
During private experiences such as painting, sex, or writing personal poetry, people will generally not want help from an outsider. Even if the outsider can help them fulfill their interests, it is still wrong to intrude on a couple failing to have sex.
	A2: [[Nagel]]: The things that make these activities great isnt the product of the work, but its the process of creating beautiful art or passioante sex independently.
