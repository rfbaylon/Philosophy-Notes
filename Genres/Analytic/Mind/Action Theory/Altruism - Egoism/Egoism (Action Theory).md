See [[Hobbes]], [[Hume]], [[CosmicSkeptic]]
See [[Moral Egoism]], [[Subjective Theory of Value]]

Since it is I that am acting, even when I act parallel to the interests of others, it must be an interest of mine that provides the impulse.

I will help another person IFF
	1. by helping them, they will be more likely to help me in the future
	2. The thought of myself in their position brings about a vivid emotional disgust

### Negative Argument from Competitive Examples
IN competitive sports, if you hold that all competing parties are equally interested (and thus equally valubale) it doesnt make sense for you to go into a boxing match and prefer yourself to win when your opponents interests are just as valuable.
	A2: [[Nagel]]: We have to ask why the match is here in teh first place. It is to provide a show for an audience, excersize the products of labour, and to earn a title for the boxers. By boxers helping eachother, they dont achieve any of these goals. The objective principle behind competition is for people to beat eachother up to create something best for both parties in its synthesis.

### Negative Argument from Private Examples
During private experiences such as painting, sex, or writing personal poetry, people will generally not want help from an outsider. Even if the outsider can help them fulfill their interests, it is still wrong to intrude on a couple failing to have sex.
	A2: [[Nagel]]: The things that make these activities great isnt the product of the work, but its the process of creating beautiful art or passioante sex independently.
