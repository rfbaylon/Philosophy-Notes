## A2 Pan-Micro: The Combination Problem
"Take a hundred of them (feelings), shuffle them and pack them as close together as you can (whatever that may mean); still each remains the same feeling it always was, shut in its own skin, windowless, ignorant of what the other feelings are and mean. There would be a hundred-and first-feeling there, if, when a group or series of such feelings were set up, a consciousness belonging to the group as such should emerge. And this 101st feeling would be a totally new fact; the 100 feelings might, by a curious physical law, be a signal for its creation, when they came together; but they would have no substantial identity with it, nor it with them, and one could never deduce the one from the others, nor (in any intelligible sense) say that they evolved it. (James 1981: 160)b"

## A2 Pan-Micro: The Subject-Summing Problem
Built from basis of [[Mereological Nihilism]] or [[Mereological Pluralism]]
I have a unique experience that excludes certain other experiences (Bob's mental state) What line can be drawn from *my* unique mental state and Bob's unique mental state? If what creates consciousness is an aggregate of simples behaving in a certain way, why does the aggregate stop right outside of my skin?
	Building on this [[Goff]] argues that we can conceive of a “micro-experiential zombie”, defined as a creature that is:
	-   Physically indiscernible from an actual human being,
	-   Such that each of its micro-level parts has conscious experience.
	-   Such that no macro-level part of the organism has conscious experience.

In essence, under panpsychism or micropsychism, how do we make sense of a subject like you or me?
	A2: Charles [[Hartshorne]] has made the distinction between “compound” and “composite” individuals, which is roughly the distinction between what is living and what is not. A compound individual is one which (or who), on a macro level, has a “dominating unit,” an inclusive locus of experience, a single subject that unifies the experiences of its components into a coherent whole. Non-living things, although made up of actual ultimates that each have a mental or experiential aspect, have no such unification of experience. Hartshorne calls them “composite” rather than “compound.
