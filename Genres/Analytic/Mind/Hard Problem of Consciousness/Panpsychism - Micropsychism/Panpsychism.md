# Panpsychism
See [[Spinoza]], [[Whitehead]]

Guiding Questions:  
Does consciousness necessitate freewill? Determinism?
Do physical phenomena create subjective experiences? How is it translated from material to immaterial?
How does something get consciousness?
Where did consciousness come from?
Will consciousness ever end?
Is everything equally conscious?

## [[Strawson]]'s Argument for Panpsychism

0.	Reality is made of only one type of stuff. There is only one ultimate category that applies to everything. We call this view Monism.
1.	Everything real has a material aspect. That is, every instance of the one type of stuff of which reality is made is observable from an external, publicly-available point of view.
2.	Our own experience, directly observable only from the point of view of the one who is having it, is indisputably real.
3.	Hence, at least some of reality has an experiential aspect as well as a material aspect.
4.	There is no radical emergence of experience from non-experiential stuff. The experiential aspect of something does not radically emerge from the material aspect. (By “radical” I mean strong, as opposed to weak, emergence. See discussion below.)
	This is proven by [[Leibniz]] in [[Micropsychism]]
5.	Hence, experience is as fundamental to reality as matter.
5.	Experience is fundamental to reality.
6.	What is real is ultimately made up of very tiny elements; these are its fundamental constituents.
7.	Hence, at least some fundamental constituents of reality are intrinsically and irreducibly experiential as well as material in nature. For short, we call this idea “[[Micropsychism]].”
7.	Micropsychism is true.
8.	The assertion that all fundamental constituents of reality are experiential as well as material is simpler than and preferable to the assertion some are and some are not. 
	Rests upon [[Ockham’s Razor]]
9.	Hence, all fundamental constituents of reality are intrinsically and irreducibly experiential in nature as well as material. For short, we call this “panpsychism.”
