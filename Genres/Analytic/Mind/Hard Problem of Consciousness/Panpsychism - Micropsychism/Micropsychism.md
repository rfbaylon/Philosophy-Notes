#### [[Leibniz]]' Argument
Perception is inexplicable on material grounds. If there were an AI that had a motion sensor for example, we shouldnt believe it is truly percieving motion. When opening a machine, we only see parts that work in conjunction, but never a part that is the "perception" part. Thus, it is in simple substance perception is found, not in any collection of things ([[The Monadology]], 17)

Perceptions can only come from other perceptions, as motion can only come from other motion.
	This means that we had perception before we were born, we just were not congnizant of it. ([[The Monadology]], 23)
