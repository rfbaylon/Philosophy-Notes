### The Imitation Game
A2: A dog cannot pass the imitation game, but still thinks
A2: A peasant in the middle ages will be much easier to fool than a human today; claiming that the machines thinking ability depends on the guesses of others seems counter intuitive. It should be thinking either way, and in one case we dont have the tools to measure it
A2: Why human intelligence? Is this test not incredibly anthropocentric?

#### Case Study: Parry
"“Parry” which its inventors claim has already passed a rudimentary version of the
Turing test. In a series of remotely conducted interviews, Parry fooled several psychiatrists who were told they were talking to either a computer or a paranoid patient. This was an improvement over an earlier version, in which psychiatrists were imply handed transcripts of short interviews and asked to determine which ones were with a genuine paranoid and which ones with a computer simulation."

### Physical Symbol System Hypothesis
See [[Newell&Simon]]
A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient conditions for general intelligent action.

Any system that incorporates physical symbols and acts upon such such a system.
	If I get the symbolic input "bear," *then* I act upon such an input and run. 

##### Evidence for the necessity claim
- Experimental data from psychology and linguistics
- Simulation data
	A2: there are better and alternative models of intelligent behavior that do not require symbolic representations

#### Heuristic Search Hypothesis
**Keep in mind, this view implies machines have desires!!**
Well structured task domains the agent has an explicit understanding of 
- initial state
	- ax+b=cx+b
- goal state
	- x=?
- operators
	- subtracting, dividing, etc
- restrictions
	- Mathematical axioms

A machine will search all possible trees in order to return a single answer by searching for it through many *many* possible legal answers.
At some point though, as in chess, there are just way too many potential moves (10^120) in order to brute force a search through all legal possibilities. Thus, machines will use heuristics to reduce the amount of searches. This is the basis for AI.

If humans have heuristics, according to [[Newell&Simon]], then it proves that humans are Physical Symbol Systems, proving machines can rise to the level of human intelligence, as we can both be PSS's

### A2 PSS Hypothesis: Chinese Room Experiment
See [[Searle]]

If I get a command through a computer to put a chinese symbol in a mail box when I see certain other symbols, this does not mean that I actually understand Chinese. 

Symbol input -> Searle (Rule Book) -> Symbol Output
Typed input -> CPU (Memory) -> Displayed Output
