### Argument from Phenomenological Simulation
See [[Dennett]]
If you genuinely felt wet, felt the rushings winds of, heard the sensations related to, and saw flying cars due to a hurricane, how exactly would you differentiate it from a simulation of a hurricane? Hurricanes, along with all other aposteriori phenomena are defined by their doing. [[Process]]
	"Suppose you consider a really deep simulation of a hurricane -- I mean a simulation of every atom, which I admit is impossibly deep. I hope you would agree that it would then share all that abstract structure that defines the “essence of hurricanehood.” So what’s to hold you back from calling it a hurricane?" [[Coffee House Conversation]], 7

### Argument from a priori Simulation
See [[Dennett]]
If a calculator comes up with a mathematical proof, it is exactly the same as a collegue coming up with a proof. What even is a simulation of a proof? Ergo, machines do not produce simulations of things, but real things via cognitive processes.

### Argument from Identity
See [[Karnofsky]]
See [[Ship of Theseus]]
If we were to replace one neuron in a brain with a techno-neuron, it seems like you would feel no difference, cognition would still happen. At no point from the transformation of one to all neurons, does that change. You will still be thinking. [[Most Important Century]], 40

# No

### God Didn't Give Machines Souls
The Bible says god solely endowed men with cognition
	A2: [[Turing]]: If it were impossible for machines to think, God would be limited in His power, a theological contradiction [[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]

### Head in the sand
I really don't like thinking about machines thinking :(
	A2: Cope harder [[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]

### [[Godel]]'s theorem Limits Answers
See [[Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem]]
With certain sets of axioms, a machine's response will either be incomplete or wrong
	A2: [[Turing]] This is also true of humans [[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]

### Argument from Consciousness
Thinking presupposes qualia. Machines do not have qualia. Ergo, machines do not think.
	A2: [[Turing]] This also applies to humans, but since it is impossible to know of other minds and if they experience qualia (like we cannot know if machines have quali) , we cannot say other people think. [[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]
		See [[Problem of other minds]], [[Solipsism]]
	A2: The machine can easily mimic thinking responses 
		A2: But here aren't [[Turing]] and jefferson working on two different definitions of thinking? 

### Machinic Unoriginality
"The Analytical Engine has no pretensions originate to anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it perform to"
	A2: Does this also not apply to humans?
	A2: Does AI not already do this?
	A2: [[Turing]] There is nothing new under the sun, everything is a synthesis or disjunction of everything else. [[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]
