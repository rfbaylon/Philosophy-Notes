Mental processes are neural processes in the brain.
Feeling of pain is an instance of a specific neurobiological property (e.g, C-fiber excitation)


## A2 Identity Theory

### A2: Multiple Realizability Argument
See [[Putnam]] 
1. Some mental states can be realized by many widely different physical kinds.
2. If a given mental kind is multiply realizable by distinct physical kinds, then it cannot be identical to any one specific physical kind.
3. Therefore, some mental kinds are not identical to any one specific physical kind.
	I think this is a knockdown argument.
