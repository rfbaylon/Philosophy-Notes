## Behaviorism
See [[Ryle]], 
There only thing that a person is is a set of behavoirs. The mind is a set of behavioral dispositions.

If someone yelps in pain, has the verbal consequence of pain, and shares the same electrochemical signals associated with pain, they are experiencing pain

All sensations are physical, all minds are a set of if -> then impiuts.


### Consequences of Behaviorism
It would be possible to experience another person's sensations


## A2 Behaviorism
[[Newell&Simon]]
There are no *suffecient* conditions to determine whether or not a machine thinks, only necessary conditions.
