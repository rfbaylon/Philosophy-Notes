The “Hard Problem of Consciousness” is the problem of how physical processes in the brain give rise to the subjective experience of the mind and of the world. - [[Chalmers]]

There is a silimar though distinct debate occuring about not what consciousness is, but what is conscious. That debate can be found here: [[What is Conscious]]

# Dualism & Idealism

## Idealism & Dualism
See [[Kant]] , [[Berkeley]], [[Hegel]], [[Descartes]], [[Chalmers]]

"Physical processes of the brain DONT give rise to the subjective experience of the mind"

### [[Berkeley]]'s Argument
[[Locke]] was right that there are certain things qualitatively that only appear to use as mere representation. But [[Locke]] was wrong in saying that quantity didnt also apply to this, as we cannot imagine an apple without quantitative form in the same way we cannot assign it without color. Therefore, everything is mere appearance.
	A2: [[Kant]]: This cannot be the case, as there must be something that our intuition represents for it to be a representation. There must be something else that we cannot comprehend, yet is still existent. This is called noumena. [[Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics]], 36

### Transcendental Idealism
See [[Kant]]
Note that just because something is a representation in the understanding, doesnt mean it is an illusion, "for all that they can correctly cohere according to rules of truth in experience" [[Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics]], 39

### [[Chalmers]]' argument from Zombies
See [[Chalmers]]
1.  Zombies are conceivable.
2.  Whatever is conceivable is possible.
3.  Therefore zombies are possible.
https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zombies/#ConcArguForPossZomb
	A2: *Everyone else* cannot be a zombie. Someone down the line of history had to have had a conscious experience in order to create a field of knowledge surrounding consciousness. How could a unconscious being know that consciousness exists? I know at least one other person in history isnt a zombie.

## A2 Dualism & Idealism

### Which Experiences are required to understand consciousness of others?
See [[Dennett]]
	If it is the case that phenomena can only be understood if the researcher is 'steeped in the domain of experiences under examination' (Who's on First?, 10), then can women not study men? Can deaf people not study musicians? 

### Dualism is a Category Mistake
Believing mind and body are two different things makes a category mistake. [[Ryle]] compares it to visiting Northeastern's campus, viewing the buildings and people, and then asking "But where is Northeastern"

### Analogy to Vitalism
[[Chalmers]] proposes a insurmountable gap in our knowledge, when in reality it could be just mere ignorance. 

In the 19th century, there was intense debate over what the fundamental part of life is. How could it possible that something living can come from a bunch of dead things? It was argued that because a living thing could not possibly come from a dead thing, life essence needs to be some fundamentally different part of the world. However, today, there is no such argumentation and all of the problems of vitalism are solved by physicalism
This, arguably, is what dualists and idealists do in relation to consciousness, and it could very well be the case that these arguments are shortsighted when it comes to understanding consciousness scientifically and materially. ([[Churchland]],  1996)

### Ignorance =/= Chasm
[[Chalmers]]' formal argument is a traditional [[Fallacy]] (argumentum ad ignorantiam)
(1) P can never be explained, or
(2) Nothing science could ever discover would deepen our understanding of P, or
(3) P can never be explained in terms of properties of kind S.

Just because there exists a gap in knowledge doesnt mean that it would be impossible to understand in the same metaphysical framework. 

"Moreover, the mysteriousness of a problem is not a fact about the problem, it is not a metaphysical feature of the universe -- it is an epistemological fact about us."
([[Churchland]],  1996)

# Physicalism
See [[Dennett]]

"The 'subjective' experience of the mind is not actually subjective"

## Physicalism

### Heterophenomenology
See [[Dennett]]


### Neurophenomenology

NCC = Neural Consciousness Correlate

This field (Lutz & Thompson , Block , Seth) is interested in finding NCCs that can reduce conscious experience to neurology. The traditional method of doing so is to find the minimal amount of activity required while perception is still happening. 

Neurophenomenology wants to incorporate first person data into a scientific approach

### Behaviorism
See [[Ryle]], 
There only thing that a person is is a set of behaviors. The mind is a set of behavioral dispositions.

If someone yelps in pain, has the verbal consequence of pain, and shares the same electrochemical signals associated with pain, they are experiencing pain

All sensations are physical, all minds are a set of if -> then inputs.

### Identity Theory
Mental processes are neural processes in the brain.
Feeling of pain is an instance of a specific neurobiological property (e.g, C-fiber excitation)
	A2: See [[Putnam]] 
		1. Some mental states can be realized by many widely different physical kinds.
		2. If a given mental kind is multiply realizable by distinct physical kinds, then it cannot be identical to any one specific physical kind.
		3. Therefore, some mental kinds are not identical to any one specific physical kind.
			I think this is a knockdown argument. 


## A2 Physicalism

### [[Wittgenstein]] on Private Language
If someone says "I feel a sensation in the frontal lobe of my brain," we have no way of disproving her. Who are we to say that they do not feel this feeling. The same goes for a water diviner who *feels* water *n* feet below the ground ([[The Blue and Brown Books]], 9) .

### Argument from [[Space]] and [[Time]]
See [[Kant]]
Because the Transcendental Aesthetic is true, we cant possibly experience objects outside of us because the term 'outside of ourselves' implies a concept of space which is impossible except as a factor of our own understanding.
