I know I am conscious. This is true because I feel something, there is knowledge of what it is like to be me and I have such knowledge. How do I know that others also have something going on upstairs instead of them being philosophical zombies?

Argument for Philosophical Zombies
1.  Zombies are conceivable.
2.  Whatever is conceivable is possible.
3.  Therefore zombies are possible.

	A2: *Everyone else* cannot be a zombie. Someone down the line of history had to have had a conscious experience in order to create a field of knowledge surrounding consciousness. How could a unconscious being know that consciousness exists? I know at least one other person in history isnt a zombie.
