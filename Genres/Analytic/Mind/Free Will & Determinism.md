Definition:
- A mind is free iff it makes decisions 100% free from any interference

# Libertarian Free Will
See [[Kant]], [[Sartre]]

## [[Kant]]'s Constructivist Position

The order of nature are all constructs of the mind. Time, space, and the laws of cause and effect all need to be filters that the understanding overlays upon our experience. Because causation can only be understood as a part of the mind, the mind in-itself is not beholden to the laws of causation. Thus, our minds are free from outside influence, making us free beings.

In the context of our understanding though, we cannot be free as our minds automatically impose cause and effect upon experience. Only when we consider the mind-in-itself, can we be free.
