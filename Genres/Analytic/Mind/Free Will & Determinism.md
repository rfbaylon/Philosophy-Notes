## Libertarian Free Will

### Constructivist Position
See [[Kant]]
The order of nature are all constructs of the mind. [[Time]], [[Space]], and the laws of [[Causation]] all need to be filters that the understanding overlays upon our experience. Because causation can only be understood as a part of the mind, the mind in-itself is not beholden to the laws of causation. Thus, our minds are free from outside influence, making us free beings.

In the context of our understanding though, we cannot be free as our minds automatically impose cause and effect upon experience. Only when we consider the mind-in-itself, can we be free.

*"In the former case reason is the cause of these laws of nature, and therefore free; in the latter, the effects follow according to mere natural laws of sensibility, because reason does not influence it. But reason itself is not determined on that account by the sensibility and is therefore free in this case too."*
([[Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics]], 93-94)
