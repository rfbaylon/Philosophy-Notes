## The meme argument
1. It is possible that God exists
2. Ergo, God exists
	Explanation: If God is defined as necessary, he would exist in all possible worlds. If he exists in a different world, he would also by extension exist in ours aswell.
		A2: There is a difference between epistemic possibility and metaphysical possibility. Although it is unknown to us whether or not he exists, a necessary being existing could be impossible metaphysically. The entire debate is about if God is possible metaphysically, not epistemically.
