# Cosmological Arguments
Any argument that argues for God via synthetic a priori argumentation

## [[W.L. Craig]]'s' Kalam Cosmological Argument
(i) Whatever begins to exist has a cause of its existence
(ii) The universe began to exist
(iii) Therefore, the universe has a cause of its existence.

Imagine walking through a forest and finding a smooth floating orb on your path. You ask in amazement, pondering the reason this orb exists here and now, but your hiking friend merely says "Oh, its here for no reason at all." This would obviously leave you frustrated, and unsatisfied as this orb could not have merely popped into existence for no reason at all.
[[W.L. Craig]] compares the theist to person A, the atheist to person B, and the orb to the universe itself. The princple demonstrated here seems to be the [[Principle of Sufficient Reason]]. Thus, [[W.L. Craig]] seems to claim that the PSR points to (not necessarily proves) God's existence.

## [[Spinoza]]'s Proof of God as Substance
See [[Spinoza]], [[Whitehead]], [[Einstein]]
- PROP. I. Substance is by nature prior to its modifications.
- PROP. II. Two substances, whose attributes are different, have nothing in common.
- PROP. III. Things which have nothing in common cannot be one the cause of the other.
- PROP. IV. Two or more distinct things are distinguished one from the other, either by the difference of the attributes of the substances, or by the difference of their modifications.
- PROP. V. There cannot exist in the universe two or more substances having the same nature or attribute.
- PROP. VI. One substance cannot be produced by another substance.
- PROP. VII. Existence belongs to the nature of substances.
- PROP. VIII. Every substance is necessarily infinite.
- PROP. IX. The more reality or being a thing has, the greater the number of its attributes (Def. iv.).
- PROP. X. Each particular attribute of the one substance must be conceived through itself.
- PROP. XI. God, or substance, consisting of infinite attributes, of which each expresses eternal and infinite essentiality, necessarily exists

## [[Leibniz]]'s proof of God from Necessity
1.  Every contingency needs a sufficient reason for itself. ([[Principle of Sufficient Reason]])
2.  An infinite series of contingencies is a contingency in and of itself.
3.  An infinite series of contingencies does not have a sufficient reason for itself.
4.  The world is an infinite series of contingencies.
5.  If the world does not have a sufficient reason for itself, then an ultimate reason for the world exists that is not a contingency.
6.  This ultimate reason contains all the details of the infinite series of contingencies (the world).
7.  God contains all the details of the infinite series of contingencies (the world)
8. Conclusion: God exists.
([[The Monadology]], 44)	
	A2: The PSR in premise 1 ([[Principle of Sufficient Reason]]) is HIGHLY controversial
	A2: If God exists and is a necessary truth, it must follow that the infinite series after God's first cause is a necessary truth aswell. If the infinite series is necessary, God no longer is.
	A2: the only thing proven is a necessary first mover, in which there are a few atheistic explanations for.
	A2: [[Hume]]: logically, something *could* be a cause, but not an effect and visa versa. Thus, the [[Principle of Sufficient Reason]] fails since there is nothing *necessarily* connecting event A and event B (See [[Causal Theories]])

Note: [[Leibniz]] has to bite the bullet that this is the best world possible because God is omnibenevolent and has a reason to choose this world over all other possible worlds. Is a good argument for [[Problem of Evil]].
