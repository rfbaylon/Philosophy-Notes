### Could God create a rock he himself could not lift?

If he is able to create a task he cannot do, then he is not truly omnipotent because there is a task he can not do. On the other hand, if he is not able to create a task he can not do, he is not truly omnipotent because he is unable to create a task he can not do.
	A2: It is logically *impossible* to create something more powerful than all power. Its an internal contradiction, and thus God cannot create this rock. God still follows laws of logic despite omnipotence.
		[[C.S. Lewis]]: "His Omnipotence means power to do all that is intrinsically possible, not to do the intrinsically impossible. You may attribute miracles to him, but not nonsense. This is no limit to his power. If you choose to say 'God can give a creature free will and at the same time withhold free will from it,' you have not succeeded in saying anything about God: meaningless combinations of words do not suddenly acquire meaning simply because we prefix to them the two other words 'God can... It is no more possible for God than for the weakest of his creatures to carry out both of two mutually exclusive alternatives; not because his power meets an obstacle, but because nonsense remains nonsense even when we talk it about God."

### How is Gods Omniscience and [[Libertarian Freewill]] compatible? 
If God knows exactly where we will end up, then we are not truly free to do as we please.
	A2: [[Leibniz]] draws out a distinction between certain and necessary. It could be the case that it is absolutely certain that there are thinking beings, but it doesn't necessarily follow that it is a brute fact of nature that it is strictly necessary for that to be the case.

	A2: It could be the case that I know my 4 year old is going to leave his dishes on the table, but that doesn't mean that he doesn't have freewill; it is just possible to notice a pattern with more knowledge
