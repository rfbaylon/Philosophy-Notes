#### How can Murder Exist with an all loving God
A2:
 God didnt make humans perfect
	A2: Why not? Then he is not all good.
Satan messes with our brains
	A2: If God were omnipotent, he could destroy satan instantly.
Freewill is more important than goodness
	A2: Is there [[Libertarian Freewill]] in heaven?
		If so, then why wouldn't God place us in heaven in the first place? If not, then life on earth is better than life in heaven if freewill is worth more than personal satisfaction.
	A2: What is more important than morality?? Is morality definitionally the only thing we ought to value?
	A2: Could God not have created a universe without evil but with free will? Or even limited will?
	A2: Why is freewill good?
The universe could not exist otherwise
	A2: But it could if God were omnipotent
Murder is good, its just a part of God's Plan ([[Leibniz]])
	A2: But God could have made the world such that he reaped the moral benefits of murder without the unnecessary pain as an omnipotent being.
 
### How can cancer exist in 3 year olds with an all loving God?

A2:
Satan messes with our brains
	A2: If God were omnipotent, he could destroy satan instantly.		
The universe could not exist otherwise
	A2: But it could if God were omnipotent
Cancer is good, its just a part of God's Plan
	A2: But God could have made the world such that he reaped the moral benefits of murder without the unnecessary pain as an omnipotent being.
Cancer is here as a test for humans to solve
	A2: If God were omnipotent, he would know what we would choose and there would be no reason to test us
	A2: Why?
	A2: Why are innocent children the target of God's 'tests'? Why not choose solely middle aged people?

### How can nonhuman animal suffering exist with an all loving God?

A2:
Animals do not matter morally, only as a means to human ends.
	A2: [[Why animals matter]]


# Euthyphro Dilemma
**Either things are good because God chose them to be so arbitrarily or because these things are good independent of God's will**
Horn 1:
	X is good becuase God arbitrarily decided it to be so. This means
		God could make school shootings morally obligatory
		[[Leibniz]]: We would have no reason to worship God because He would be equally good no matter what he chose.
Horn 2:
	X is good because X has the property of goodness independent of God's will.
		God is not omnipotent
			A2: God will never be able to do anything such that it violates reason itself (as he is perfect and holds only adequate beliefs), and as morality is a priori, it would be against God's nature to be immoral. It is a contradiction.
