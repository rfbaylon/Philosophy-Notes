### Schizophrenia

"**Schizophrenia is desiring production as the limit of social production**" [[Anti-Oedipus]], 35

Schizophrenia is the universe of productive and reproductive desiring-machines, universal primary production as the "essential reality of man *and* nature" [[Anti-Oedipus]], 5

# Machines
**A machine is an actual object that produces**

Since every object produces something (as it is causally effective upon some other object some how), every thing is a machine.
	"Everything is a machine." [[Anti-Oedipus]], 2

Hence, everything is a production.

### Celibate Machines

Let us term celibate machine that which forms a new alliance between the desiring-machine and the BwO so as to give birth to a new humanity or a glorious organism


## Assemblages

Each assemblage has both content and expression
	Content: The machinic assemblage of bodies; the assemblage in itself 
	Expression: The collective assemblage of enunciation of the assemblage; the way it is sensed by other machines
		This discussion is reminiscent of [[Whitehead]]'s theory of an actual entity, and the datum of said entity realized in another actual entity.

Each assemblage has a side of territorialization and deterritorialization
	Territorial: Stabilization of the assemblage; states that affirm the will to power of the assemblage
	Deterritorial: Destabilization of the assemblage; machines that undermine the will to power of the assemblage

[[Kafka]] is said to be incredible at not only differentiating the poles of these axes, but making a synthesis from them in a minor language. [[A Thousand Plateaus]], 88

## Desiring Machines
Embody the Connective Synthesis (And, And, And)

Desiring machines (perhaps all machines?) are binary: one machine is always paired with another; one gives and gives, and the other receives flows from the opposite machine. Both machines can fill both roles at the same time. 
	Breast machine gives milk, energy flows, to the mouth machine which receives the flows.
	One machine that produces will always be grafted on to (ingressing upon, to use the [[Whitehead]]ian term) the product.

Desiring machines make us an organism, a collection of machines organized in a particular way to produce a particular product.

### Socius

**The socius is the full body (organs + BwO) of the production of recording (memory); it is the social machine**

The goal of the socius is to code social desire

#### Recording
Embodies the Conjunctive Synthesis

**Recording is the production of production**

### 3 Syntheses
#### Connective
And, And, And, And
	Aka libido; synthesis of production
	Formula for desire

#### Disjunctive
Either, Or, Or, Or, Or
	Aka numan; synthesis of recording
	Satisfies or rejects certain connections

#### Conjunctive
So Its...
	Aka voluptus; synthesis of consummation

## Body Without Organs
AKA BwO
Embody the Disjunctive Synthesis (either/or)

**A BwO is the unproductive canvas upon which desiring machines latch and organize; it is the pure potentiality of the organism**
	This may be similar to [[Whitehead]]'s "Eternal Object"

Think of a BwO as a virgin field. It is essentially unproductive; it has no seeds, no productive value, it is a blank canvas. Seeds sewn into the BwO latch onto the surface of the field and thus begin or organize themselves and produce vegetables. The seeds are desiring machines, the field is the BwO, and the combination of the two as a process is the body of the farm. 

"A BwO is the unproductive, the sterile, the ungendered, the unconsumable" [[Anti-Oedipus]], 8

#### Examples of BwOs
An Egg
Capital (BwO of the capitalist)
The Nongendered Body of an Infant ([[Butler]])
