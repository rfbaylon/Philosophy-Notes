Jorge Luis Borges' description of language on the planet Tlön, whose inhabitants take process as their default:
'For example, there is no noun that corresponds to our word “moon”, but there is a verb... “to moonate” or “to enmoon”. “The moon rose above the river”... translates [as] “Upward, behind the onstreaming it mooned”' (2000, pp. 13).
