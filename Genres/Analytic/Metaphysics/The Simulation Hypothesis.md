# The Simulation Hypothesis

#### Presuppositions:
This hypothesis presupposes some sort of physicalist position on consciousness (See [[Hard Problem of Consciousness]])

#### Thesis:
At least one of the following propositions is true:
1. The human species is very likely to go extinct before Posthumanism
2. Any posthuman civilization is extremally unlikely to run a significant number of simulations of their evolutionary history
3. We are almost certainly living in a computer simulation
([[Bostrom]], Pg 1, 2001)

Alternatively,
"Unless we are now living in a simulation, our descendants will almost certainly never run an ancestor-simulation."
( [[Bostrom]], Pg 14, 2001

## The Simulation Hypothesis
See [[Bostrom]]

### Mathematical Argument
See [[Bostrom]]
Fsim : Odds we are in a simulation
Fp : Fraction of all human‐level technological civilizations that survive to reach a posthuman stage
Ni : Average number of ancestor simulations run by a posthuman civilization
Fi : For the fraction of posthuman civilizations that are interested in running ancestor]simulations

## A2 The Simulation Hypothesis

### Ethical Argument
A posthuman civilization would not ethically allow for simulations to be run as it would cause massive suffering towards people and relies on deception. 
	A2: It is not clear that the existence of the human race is a bad thing, and in fact it could very well be said to be a very very good thing despite the suffering of individuals
	([[Bostrom]], Pg 11, 2001)
	A2: There is no guarantee that posthumans would act ethically
