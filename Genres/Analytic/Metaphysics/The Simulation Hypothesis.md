# The Simulation Hypothesis

#### Presuppositions:
This hypothesis presupposes some sort of physicalist position on consciousness (See [[Hard Problem of Consciousness]])

#### Thesis:
At least one of the following propositions is true:
1. The human species is very likely to go extinct before Posthumanism
2. Any posthuman civilization is extremally unlikely to run a significant number of simulations of their evolutionary history
3. We are almost certainly living in a computer simulation
([[Bostrom]], Pg 1, 2001)

Alternatively,
"Unless we are now living in a simulation, our descendants will almost certainly never run an ancestor-simulation."
( [[Bostrom]], Pg 14, 2001

## The Simulation Hypothesis
See [[Bostrom]]

### Mathematical Argument
See [[Bostrom]]
Fsim : Odds we are in a simulation
Fp : Fraction of all human‐level technological civilizations that survive to reach a posthuman stage
Ni : Average number of ancestor simulations run by a posthuman civilization
Fi : For the fraction of posthuman civilizations that are interested in running ancestor]simulations

[[Chalmers]] theoriezes a 'sim blocker' as a proble other path way, making his confidence 25%.


### Analogy to the Sleeping Beauty Problem

If the answer to the sleeping beauty problem is that P1, P2, and P3 are all equal (which Elga, Fallis, and Lewis argue), then it is the case that given the possibility of recurring simulation, the probabiliy that you are a sim is near 1. 

Sleeping Beauty Problem:
P(Tails and Tuesday) = P(Tails and Monday) = P(Heads and Monday).
Analagously, 
P(Unsimmed and Not Sim) = P(Simmed and Not Sim) = P(Simmed and a Sim[1]) = P(Simmed and a Sim[2]) ...= P(Simmed and a Sim[N])

#### The Formalized Argument
P1: Sleeping Beauty should be 1/3 confident that the coin will be heads
P2: If P1, then either Elga OR the Horgan-Milano approach
P3: if in the case of the sailors child, you should be 1/3 confident that the coin landed heads
P4: If the Horgan-Milano Approach, then not P3
C1: So, the Elga Approach
P5: If the Elga Approach, then we should be almost certain that we live in a simulation
C2: So, we should be almost certain that we live in a simulation. 

## A2 The Simulation Hypothesis

### Ethical Argument
A posthuman civilization would not ethically allow for simulations to be run as it would cause massive suffering towards people and relies on deception. 
	A2: It is not clear that the existence of the human race is a bad thing, and in fact it could very well be said to be a very very good thing despite the suffering of individuals
	([[Bostrom]], Pg 11, 2001)
	A2: There is no guarantee that posthumans would act ethically
