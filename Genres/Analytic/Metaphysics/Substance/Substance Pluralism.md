See [[Leibniz]]

Leibniz: There are infinite, indestructable (and unproducable) substances that each have a soul. Because each soul is fundamentally acausal with each other soul, they create the building blocks for the universe. He calls these monads in [[The Monadology]]
	A2: How can God have knowledge of each experience if substances are acausal? Would something not have to cause the information to exist in the mind of God?
	A2: This is specifically in reference to his _Discourse On Metaphysics_ in which in paragraph XIV says "A particular substance never acts on another particular substance" and in paragraph XVI says "...God being the true cause of substances." If God Himself is a substance, how can Leibniz take all of these to be true?
