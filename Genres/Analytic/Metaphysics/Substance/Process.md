See [[Whitehead]], [[Deleuze]]

Whitehead rejects the popular presupposition that "substance" is a being. [[Spinoza]], [[Descartes]], [[Kant]], [[Berkeley]], [[Aristotle]] all believe in a fundamental being upon which every*thing* rests. This is an incredibly radical break. 

Instead [[Whitehead]] claims the fundamental nature of the universe is a *process* isntead of a *thing*; a becoming instead of a being. This fundamental process is what Whitehead calls Creativity, the process by which things are created. This is *similar to* but not quite [[Hegel]]'s Absolute or [[Spinoza]]'s God.
