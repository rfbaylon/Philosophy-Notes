Also called Physicalism
See [[Dennett]]

The only things that exist are things that are able to be reduced to something that can be sensed (Touched, tasted, seen, smelled, heard)

Consciousness and qualia can thus also be reduced to physical terms that can be objectively measured. "Qualia" doesnt exist, it is a mere illusion.
