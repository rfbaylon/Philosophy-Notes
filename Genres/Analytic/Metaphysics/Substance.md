## What is Substance?

[[Leibniz]]
A substance is a being so complete that it allows the deduction of all of its modes 
	[[Discourse on Metaphysics]], VII

The number of substances is always the same, as substances cannot interact with one another.
Each substance imperfectly mirrors the substance of Gods


# Monism
See [[Berkeley]], [[Kant]], [[Hegel]], [[Rationalism, Empiricism, & Idealism]] , [[Spinoza]] , [[Dennett]]

# Process
See [[Whitehead]], [[Deleuze]], [[Bergson]]

Process Philosophers reject the popular presupposition that "substance" is a being. [[Spinoza]], [[Descartes]], [[Kant]], [[Berkeley]], [[Aristotle]] all believe in a fundamental being upon which every*thing* rests. This is an incredibly radical break. 

Instead [[Whitehead]] claims the fundamental nature of the universe is a *process* isntead of a *thing*; a becoming instead of a being. This fundamental process is what Whitehead calls Creativity, the process by which things are created. This is *similar to* but not quite [[Hegel]]'s Absolute or [[Spinoza]]'s God. 


## Process
### [[Bergson]]'s argument for Duration
Time is the fundamental substance as things cannot be taken out of context of time. The traditional [[Plato]]nist methodology is to examine what is through taking a snapshot of each moment when in reality this is impossible.
	"reality is a succession of states each of which announces what follows and contains what precedes... In reality, no (moment) begins or ends; they all dove-tail into one another" 
	([[Introduction to Metaphysics]], 11)
	"(traditional philosophers) have sought the meaning of a poem in the form of the letters that make it up, (they) have thought that in considering an increasing number of letters (they) would finally embrace the constantly fleeting meaning, and as a last resource, seeing that it was no use to seek a part of the meaning in each letter and the one following the missing fragment of the mysterious meaning!" ([[Introduction to Metaphysics]], 46)

Taking duration as the fundamental process of reality, it unites multiplicity and unity. The unity of moments is the continuous thread  or stream of infinite moments of time that flows through them like beads on a string. Duration *is* the synthesis of unity and multiplicity.
	"If I consider duration as a multiplicity of moments bound to tone another by a unity which runs through them like a thread, these moments, no matter how short the chosen duration, are unlimited in number" ([[Introduction to Metaphysics]], 53)

#### [[Bergson]]'s Principles
All from [[Introduction to Metaphysics]], all are quotes (sans the subbed notes on each proposition)

I. There is an external reality which is given immediately to the mind (59)
	[[Berkeley]]'s idealism is false
II. All reality is tendency if we agree to call tendency a nascent change of direction (60)
	Nascent = pregnant
	We have access to this as we know our consciousness is a stream, there is no such thing as a nontemporal consciousness
III. Our intelligence, when it follows its natural inclination, proceeds by solid perceptions (intuition) on the one hand and stable connections (analysis) on the other (61)
IV. It is understood that fixed concepts can be extended by our thought from the mobile reality; but there is no means whatsoever of reconstituting with the fixity of concepts the mobility of the real. (62)
	I.e, Fixed concepts can be extracted from the real, but We cannot faithfully use concepts to represent the real
V. All knowledge must necessarily start from rigidly defined concepts in order to grasp by their means the flowing reality. (63)
	The Concept -> Object vector was always bound to fail
VI. To philosophize means to reverse the normal direction of the workings of thought (64)
	The goal of philosophy is to abandon the doomed-to-fail schema of Concept -> Object and instead think in reverse; Object -> Concept. 
VII. One of the objects of metaphysics is to operate differentiations (related to [[Deleuze]]'s *difference*) and qualitative integrations (66)
	We need metaphysics to be able to incorporate quality
	We ought to stop ourselves from attempting to represent the absolute as a symbol, it will never work and will obfuscate the goal of metaphysics 
		(Could be an interesting intersection with the iconoclasm of [[Islam]])
VIII. Relative is symbolic knowledge through pre-existing concepts, which goes from the fixed to the moving, but not so intuitive knowledge which establishes itself in the moving reality and adopts the life itself of things
	Relativity is not intuitive, it is symbolic.
IX. The whole [[Critique of Pure Reason]] leads to establishing the fact that [[Plato]]nism, illegitimate if Ideas are things, becomes legitimate  if ideas are relations, and that the ready-made idea, once thus brought down from heaven to earth, is indeed as Plato wished, the common basis of thought is incapable of anything but Platonizing.
	[[Kant]]'s genius is his ability to push symbolic  metaphysics to its edge to show that all metaphysics (as Kant understood it) was symbolic.
	This sentiment echoes [[Whitehead]]'s claim that "all of Western Philosophy is footnotes to [[Plato]]"

## Pluralism
### Monads
Leibniz: There are infinite, indestructible (and unproducible) substances that each have a soul. Because each soul is fundamentally acausal with each other soul, they create the building blocks for the universe. He calls these monads in [[The Monadology]]
	A2: How can God have knowledge of each experience if substances are acausal? Would something not have to cause the information to exist in the mind of God?
	A2: This is specifically in reference to his _Discourse On Metaphysics_ in which in paragraph XIV says "A particular substance never acts on another particular substance" and in paragraph XVI says "...God being the true cause of substances." If God Himself is a substance, how can Leibniz take all of these to be true?
