## Nature A vs Nature B
Nature A
AKA natura naturata ([[Spinoza]])
AKA First Nature ([[Hegel]], [[Marx]])
	“all the powers existing in either the outer or the inner world and everything which takes place by means of those powers” ([[J.S. Mill; A Selection of His Works]], 431).
	as opposed to Supernatural

Nature B
AKA Natura Naturans ([[Spinoza]])
AKA Second Nature ([[Hegel]], [[Marx]])
	“without the… agency of man" ([[J.S. Mill; A Selection of His Works]], 431).
	as opposed to artificial


# Against Nature

## Nature A

### Semantic Uselessness
"this tree is natural" = "This tree is"
"naturally grown orange" = "orange"
	The word 'natural' in these examples dont add any added description to the statements they inhabit. We might aswell not use the word at all. 

[[Whitehead]] Everything perceived is in nature. We may not pick and choose.
For us the red glow of the sunset should be as much part of nature as are
the molecules and electric waves by which men of science would explain
the phenomenon (CN, 29)

When men of science describe the interaction between electromagnetic radiation and
the suspended molecules that inhabit the atmosphere, linking the red glow to atmospheric pollution, they do not insult the poet.

## Nature B
See [[History of Post-Structuralism]]

### [[Vogel]]'s Evolutionary Argument
*Similar to [[Name That Trait]]*
Given that humans are ourselves part of the natural process of evolution, at what point from formative primate to homo sapien sapien did we gain the capacity to make things unnatural? When did we become unnatural? What exact trait (besides humanness, as that is circular) did we acquire along the evolutionary trail that no other ‘natural’ being possesses? ([[Thinking like a Mall]], 11)
	A2: It could be our ability to manipulate our environment that makes us distinct
		A2A2: Do beavers not do this when building dams? Are beavers thus unnatural?
		A2A2: Doesnt everything affect ecosystems in some way, making everything unnatural?
	A2: It could be our intelligence
		A2A2: There are many nonhuman animals that are smarter than many humans. Does this make some humans unnatural or some nonhuman animals artificial?
	A2: By virtue of being human, we are unnatural
		A2A2: This is a Question Begging [[Fallacy]]
	

### [[Vogel]]'s Nature vs Shrature argument
 the term ‘nature’ to refer to anything that homo sapien sapiens don't affect makes just as much conceptual ontological sense as ‘shrature’ to refer to anything shrimp don't affect. In the same way a human walking over a virgin field, creating footprints in her path destroys nature, a shrimp paddling through shrimpless water destroys shrature.
	“…to make such definitions would be silly, and to lament the destruction thereby defined into existence would be even sillier” ([[Thinking like a Mall]], 15).


### [[Zizek]]'s Argument from Cultural Dependence
Nature means different things over time, it is a word solely used as a mechanism for power. 
	For example, Gayness was seen as unnatural, mostly as an argument against gayness. It didnt matter the actual definition of the term, how its used doesnt mean anything besides "This is Icky"

### The Argument from Nonuniqueness
See [[Deleuze]] & [[Guattari]]

The burden of proof lies on the author posting a distinction between humans and nature. If this goes suffeceintly unproven, there is no distinction. 
Further, if one starts from an atomistic metaphysics, there can be no development of a human nature dichotomy as humans are made from (meaningfully) the same stuff as "natural" entities such as trees or rocks. 
	"There is no such thing as wither man or nature now, only a process that produces the one within the other and couples the machines together" [[Anti-Oedipus]], 2
