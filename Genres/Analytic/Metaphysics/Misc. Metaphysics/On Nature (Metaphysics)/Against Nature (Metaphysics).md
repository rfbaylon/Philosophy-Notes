# Against Nature

## Nature A

### Semantic Uselessness
"this tree is natural" = "This tree is"
"naturally grown orange" = "orange"
	The word 'natural' in these examples dont add any added description to the statements they inhabit. We might aswell not use the word at all. 

everything perceived is in nature. We may not pick and choose.
For us the red glow of the sunset should be as much part of nature as are
the molecules and electric waves by which men of science would explain
the phenomenon (CN, 29)
-whitehead
When men
of science describe the interaction between electromagnetic radiation and
the suspended molecules that inhabit the atmosphere, linking the red glow
to atmospheric pollution, they do not insult the poet.
## Nature B

### [[Vogel]]'s Evolutionary Argument
*Similar to [[Name That Trait]]*
Given that humans are ourselves part of the natural process of evolution, at what point from formative primate to homo sapien sapien did we gain the capacity to make things unnatural? When did we become unnatural? What exact trait (besides humanness, as that is circular) did we acquire along the evolutionary trail that no other ‘natural’ being possesses? ([[Thinking like a Mall]], 11)
	A2: It could be our ability to manipulate our environment that makes us distinct
		A2A2: Do beavers not do this when building dams? Are beavers thus unnatural?
		A2A2: Doesnt everything affect ecosystems in some way, making everything unnatural?
	A2: It could be our intelligence
		A2A2: There are many nonhuman animals that are smarter than many humans. Does this make some humans unnatural or some nonhuman animals artificial?
	A2: By virtue of being human, we are unnatural
		A2A2: This is a Question Begging [[Fallacy]]
	

### [[Vogel]]'s Nature vs Shrature argument
 the term ‘nature’ to refer to anything that homo sapien sapiens don't affect makes just as much conceptual ontological sense as ‘shrature’ to refer to anything shrimp don't affect. In the same way a human walking over a virgin field, creating footprints in her path destroys nature, a shrimp paddling through shrimpless water destroys shrature.
	“…to make such definitions would be silly, and to lament the destruction thereby defined into existence would be even sillier” ([[Thinking like a Mall]], 15).


### [[Zizek]]'s Argument from Cultural Dependence
Nature means different things over time, it is a word solely used as a mechanism for power. 
	For example, Gayness was seen as unnatural, mostly as an argument against gayness. It didnt matter the actual definition of the term, how its used doesnt mean anything besides "This is Icky"
