What is Space?
### Space is an actual thing
A2: [[Kant]]: This cannot be the case as space is a prerequisite for thing-ness. A thing cannot be a thing without space, so clearly spatiality *precedes* existence as a thing.

### Space is a property of things
A2: [[Kant]]: This cannot be the case as we cant think about space-sans-thing

### Space is a filter of the Intuition
See [[Kant]]
