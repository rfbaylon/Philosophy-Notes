# Platonic Realism
Each soul has a plaonic form of perfection, i.e, what the best form would be of an object. Leibniz claims that these forms (that he calls substantial form) are both acausal and differentiate depending on the type of soul an object has. For example, an intelligent soul's perfect form is that of a spirit. See [[What is Conscious]] > Micropsychism, [[Leibniz' Heriarchy.png]]
