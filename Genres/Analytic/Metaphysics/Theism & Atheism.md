God is defined as an Omnipotent, Omniscient, Omnipresent, Omnitemporal, and Omnibenevolent being

# Theism

## Cosmological Arguments
Any argument that argues for God via synthetic a priori argumentation

### [[W.L. Craig]]'s' Kalam Cosmological Argument
(i) Whatever begins to exist has a cause of its existence
(ii) The universe began to exist
(iii) Therefore, the universe has a cause of its existence.

Imagine walking through a forest and finding a smooth floating orb on your path. You ask in amazement, pondering the reason this orb exists here and now, but your hiking friend merely says "Oh, its here for no reason at all." This would obviously leave you frustrated, and unsatisfied as this orb could not have merely popped into existence for no reason at all.
[[W.L. Craig]] compares the theist to person A, the atheist to person B, and the orb to the universe itself. The princple demonstrated here seems to be the [[Principle of Sufficient Reason]]. Thus, [[W.L. Craig]] seems to claim that the PSR points to (not necessarily proves) God's existence.

### [[Spinoza]]'s Proof of God as Substance
See [[Spinoza]], [[Whitehead]], [[Einstein]]
- PROP. I. Substance is by nature prior to its modifications.
- PROP. II. Two substances, whose attributes are different, have nothing in common.
- PROP. III. Things which have nothing in common cannot be one the cause of the other.
- PROP. IV. Two or more distinct things are distinguished one from the other, either by the difference of the attributes of the substances, or by the difference of their modifications.
- PROP. V. There cannot exist in the universe two or more substances having the same nature or attribute.
- PROP. VI. One substance cannot be produced by another substance.
- PROP. VII. Existence belongs to the nature of substances.
- PROP. VIII. Every substance is necessarily infinite.
- PROP. IX. The more reality or being a thing has, the greater the number of its attributes (Def. iv.).
- PROP. X. Each particular attribute of the one substance must be conceived through itself.
- PROP. XI. God, or substance, consisting of infinite attributes, of which each expresses eternal and infinite essentiality, necessarily exists

### [[Leibniz]]'s proof of God from Necessity
1.  Every contingency needs a sufficient reason for itself. ([[Principle of Sufficient Reason]])
2.  An infinite series of contingencies is a contingency in and of itself.
3.  An infinite series of contingencies does not have a sufficient reason for itself.
4.  The world is an infinite series of contingencies.
5.  If the world does not have a sufficient reason for itself, then an ultimate reason for the world exists that is not a contingency.
6.  This ultimate reason contains all the details of the infinite series of contingencies (the world).
7.  God contains all the details of the infinite series of contingencies (the world)
8. Conclusion: God exists.
([[The Monadology]], 44)	
	A2: The PSR in premise 1 ([[Principle of Sufficient Reason]]) is HIGHLY controversial
	A2: If God exists and is a necessary truth, it must follow that the infinite series after God's first cause is a necessary truth aswell. If the infinite series is necessary, God no longer is.
	A2: the only thing proven is a necessary first mover, in which there are a few atheistic explanations for.
	A2: [[Hume]]: logically, something *could* be a cause, but not an effect and visa versa. Thus, the [[Principle of Sufficient Reason]] fails since there is nothing *necessarily* connecting event A and event B (See [[Genres/Analytic/Metaphysics/Causation/Causation]])

Note: [[Leibniz]] has to bite the bullet that this is the best world possible because God is omnibenevolent and has a reason to choose this world over all other possible worlds. Is a good argument for [[Problem of Evil]].

## Ontological Arguments

### The Meme Argument
1. It is possible that God exists
2. Ergo, God exists
	Explanation: If God is defined as necessary, he would exist in all possible worlds. If he exists in a different world, he would also by extension exist in ours aswell.
		A2: There is a difference between epistemic possibility and metaphysical possibility. Although it is unknown to us whether or not he exists, a necessary being existing could be impossible metaphysically. The entire debate is about if God is possible metaphysically, not epistemically.


## Pragmatic Arguments
See [[Pascal]], [[Kierkegaard]]

### [[Pascal]]'s Wager
If God exists and you believe in God, you get eternal happiness
If God doesnt exist, and you believe in God, nothing happens

If God doesnt exist and you *dont* believe in God, nothing happens
If God exists and you *dont* believe in God, you get eternal hell

Clearly, the more rational choice between these two situtions is the one with a chance at eternal happiness rather than one that could lead to eternal suffering in Hell. 
	A2: 

## Teleological Arguments

## Revelatory Arguments

## Miraculous Arguments
The existence of miracles proves that God exists

Need positive argument here, #WIP 
	A2: [[Leibniz]]: God's nature is perfectly regular, as ordinary actions of God and extraordinary actions of God collapse. God creates and follows universal laws. The existence of certain miracles are just statistical chance. [[Discourse on Metaphysics]], VI


# Atheism

## Epistemic Arguments

### Argument from Divine Hiddeness
See [[CosmicSkeptic]]

Why arent some people born into cultures by which they could reasonable attain knowledge of God? As another aside, why is God more hidden to intellectuals (even ones that try to pray, go to church, etc) than nonintellectuals? What can someone do to have a divine revalation?
	A2: [[Leibniz]] if everyone got the answers at the same time, there would be no work to do for those better off. The existence of some clueless people is necessary to make the greatest possible world


## Problems of Evil
See [[Hume]], [[Nietzsche]], [[Russell]], [[Epicurus]]

### How can Murder Exist with an all loving God
Murder is bad, God would not let bad things to e
 God didnt make humans perfect
	A2: Why not? Then he is not all good.
Satan messes with our brains
	A2: If God were omnipotent, he could destroy satan instantly.
Freewill is more important than goodness
	A2: Is there Libertarian Freewill (See [[Free Will & Determinism]]) in heaven?
		If so, then why wouldn't God place us in heaven in the first place? If not, then life on earth is better than life in heaven if freewill is worth more than personal satisfaction.
	A2: What is more important than morality?? Is morality definitionally the only thing we ought to value?
	A2: Could God not have created a universe without evil but with free will? Or even limited will?
	A2: Why is freewill good?
The universe could not exist otherwise
	A2: But it could if God were omnipotent
Murder is good, its just a part of God's Plan ([[Leibniz]])
	A2: But God could have made the world such that he reaped the moral benefits of murder without the unnecessary pain as an omnipotent being.
 
### How can cancer exist in 3 year olds with an all loving God?

A2:
Satan messes with our brains
	A2: If God were omnipotent, he could destroy satan instantly.		
The universe could not exist otherwise
	A2: But it could if God were omnipotent
Cancer is good, its just a part of God's Plan
	A2: But God could have made the world such that he reaped the moral benefits of murder without the unnecessary pain as an omnipotent being.
Cancer is here as a test for humans to solve
	A2: If God were omnipotent, he would know what we would choose and there would be no reason to test us
	A2: Why?
	A2: Why are innocent children the target of God's 'tests'? Why not choose solely middle aged people?

### How can nonhuman animal suffering exist with an all loving God?

A2:
Animals do not matter morally, only as a means to human ends.
	A2: [[Why animals matter]]


### Euthyphro Dilemma
**Either things are good because God chose them to be so arbitrarily or because these things are good independent of God's will**
Horn 1:
	X is good becuase God arbitrarily decided it to be so. This means
		God could make school shootings morally obligatory
		[[Leibniz]]: We would have no reason to worship God because He would be equally good no matter what he chose.
Horn 2:
	X is good because X has the property of goodness independent of God's will.
		God is not omnipotent
			A2: God will never be able to do anything such that it violates reason itself (as he is perfect and holds only adequate beliefs), and as morality is a priori, it would be against God's nature to be immoral. It is a contradiction. 


## Metaphysical Arguments


### Could God create a rock he himself could not lift?

If he is able to create a task he cannot do, then he is not truly omnipotent because there is a task he can not do. On the other hand, if he is not able to create a task he can not do, he is not truly omnipotent because he is unable to create a task he can not do.
	A2: It is logically *impossible* to create something more powerful than all power. Its an internal contradiction, and thus God cannot create this rock. God still follows laws of logic despite omnipotence.
		[[C.S. Lewis]]: "His Omnipotence means power to do all that is intrinsically possible, not to do the intrinsically impossible. You may attribute miracles to him, but not nonsense. This is no limit to his power. If you choose to say 'God can give a creature free will and at the same time withhold free will from it,' you have not succeeded in saying anything about God: meaningless combinations of words do not suddenly acquire meaning simply because we prefix to them the two other words 'God can... It is no more possible for God than for the weakest of his creatures to carry out both of two mutually exclusive alternatives; not because his power meets an obstacle, but because nonsense remains nonsense even when we talk it about God."

### How is Gods Omniscience and Libertarian Freewill compatible? 
See [[Free Will & Determinism]]
If God knows exactly where we will end up, then we are not truly free to do as we please.
	A2: [[Leibniz]] draws out a distinction between certain and necessary. It could be the case that it is absolutely certain that there are thinking beings, but it doesn't necessarily follow that it is a brute fact of nature that it is strictly necessary for that to be the case. [[Discourse on Metaphysics]], XIII
	A2: It could be the case that I know my 4 year old is going to leave his dishes on the table, but that doesn't mean that he doesn't have freewill; it is just possible to notice a pattern with more knowledge
