## The Feminist Critique of Psychoanalysis

## [[Lacan]]ian Psychoanalysis
See [[Butler]]
In Lacanian Psychoanalysis, women are said to 'be' the phallus iin that they reflect thge power of the phallus and to be the site upon which it penetrates. Thus, women must posture in their lack (of phallus) as the essential function of men. [[Lacan]] also touches on women performing the masquerade of "appearing as being the phallus." which makes feminimity an eternal "Femininity becomes a mask that dominates/resolves a masculine identification"
	The issue is it puts women in terms of the utility to the man, not as an individual in their own right. Just phrasing the woman in terms of her 'lack' implies the [[Wittig]]ian idea that there are men and Otherized-men (women).
	Any system of cis-het psychoanalytic theory will output cis-het diagnoses for patients.
	Lacan here also divides gender in two, implicitly reinforcing the gender binary: there are only two genders: Men and masqueraders


## [[Freud]]ian Psychoanalysis
See [[Butler]]

Bisexuality, under Freud, is the clashing of two heterosexual urges in one brain: A female urge and a male urge. There is no homosexuality, only confused heterosexuality
	Any system by which cis-heteronormativity is the starting point will also be the end product. Because Freud defines the master signifier (the "normal") as heterosexuality, everything is in terms of making desires fit into the understanding of such a signifier.

Melancholia is the innate desire for women to have a penis. Melancholia is not only a 'woman disease,' but the norm for women.
