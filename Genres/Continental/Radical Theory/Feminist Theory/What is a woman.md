[[My Stance]] on the definition of gender: I think Butler is right about gender performativity.

##### Biological Essentialism
A woman is an adult human female (female defined by disposition to create female gametes (ova))

##### Psychological Essentialism
A woman is someone who has the psychological predisposition to desire to fit the social role of femininity
	A2: Does this not collapse into the gender performativity thesis? 
	A2: If someone feels ambivalent about their gender but is assigned female at birth, would their lack of desire make them not a woman?

##### Gender Performativism
A woman is someone who performs the social role of "femininity" in society
	See [[Butler]]
		A2: If you buy this, you also have to bite the bullet on transracialism existing

##### Gender Oppressionism
A woman is someone who is oppressed by the patriarchy (SOURCE)

##### Self-ID View
A woman is someone who identifies as a woman
	A2: This definition is circular. Lets abstract the general form to create an ad absurdum.
		A {     } is someone who identifies as a {     }.
		A  {{   }} is someone who identifies as a {     }.
		A  {{{ }}} is someone who identifies as a {{     }}.
		OR
		A woman is someone who identifies as a woman
		A woman self identified person is someone who identifies as identifying as a woman'
		A woman self identified self identified person is someone who identifies as identifying as identifying as a woman
		Clearly the latter few are absurd, very few people if any identify as identifying as (...) a woman, meaning they are not women by this definition.
	A2: Begs the question [[Fallacy]]
	A2: the author constructs a [[Private Language]] by creating such a definition, and thus the claim is unverifiable at best ([[Wittgenstein]])

##### Gender prescriptivism 
A woman is someone who society ought to treat as a woman
	A2: This view is not metaphysical in nature, but moral. Even if we ought to treat someone as a woman for ethical reasons, that does not mean that they actually are a women. These are distinct things. 

##### Gender Nihilism 
Women dont exist, a 'woman' is an absurd concept.
