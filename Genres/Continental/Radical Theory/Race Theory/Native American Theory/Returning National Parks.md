### Practicality
There is no way in practice that this can happen. Would the land be private? If tribes are rationally inclined to earn as much money as possible, especially given their prior economic situation, could this lead to industrialization of National Parks? Who would fund the already underfunded national parks? Would the USFG have any say in what happens to National Parks? What activities would be allowed?

Also, has anything like this ever been done? How has this worked in the past?

### On GP
If the USFG owns the National Parks, it implies everyone has equal ownership of the land, making it truly public. If a small tribe owns it, then it claims one person has more rule over a land parcel than another. Instead, we should be going after *private* land rather than public to give to tribes, as no one person ought to own a parcel of a communal good.
