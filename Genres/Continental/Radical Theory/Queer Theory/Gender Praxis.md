# The Positive Task 
"The critical task is, rather, to locate strategies of subversive repetition enabled by these constructions, to affirm the local possibilities of intervention through participating in precisely those practices or reptation that constitute identity and, therefore, present the immanent possibility of contesting them" [[Gender Trouble]], 188

## Drag
See [[Butler]]

### Drag and Performativity
See "Performativism" heading under [[What is a Woman]]

It is also important to note that in drag shows, one refers to someone in femme drag as "her" despite whatever sex they may be, or even whatever gender they may perform in their day to day lives. Despite either of these, the performer will still be "her."
	"In imitating gender, drag, implicitly reveals the imitative structure of gender itself - as well as its contingency" [[Gender Trouble]] 175
