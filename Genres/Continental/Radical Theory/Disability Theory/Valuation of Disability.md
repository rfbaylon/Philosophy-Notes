# Disability Valuation
See [[Sentience Hierarchies]], 
**Is a disabled life as valuable as an abled life?**

## No
See [[Singer]]
See [[Pro-Euthanasia]],

### [[Singer]]'s Argument from Analogy
There must be some sort of line that makes disabilities undesirable. For example, from the Thalidomide scare in Africa, large companies had to pay incredible amounts in order to compensate African families for selling a drug that created children that didnt have arms or legs. If one wants to hold the contrapositive (that both lives are equally worth living), then they also ought to hold that the company that gave Thalidomide did nothing wrong.

## Yes
 See [[Euthanasia]]
