# A2 Subjective Theory of Value

### #MyArgument Effective Altruist Critique
If it is true that the value of something is what the market will pay for it, the value of a human life is only $3,000 ([[Global Poverty]]). Its not just the case that people see their jet skis as more valuable than the life of a human, but it is *genuinely* the case that owning a jet ski is more valuable than saving a child's life, and the market *ought* to favor jet ski production over saving lives.
