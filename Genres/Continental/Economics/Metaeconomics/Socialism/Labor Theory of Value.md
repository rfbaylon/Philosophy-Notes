# Labor Theory of Value
See [[Marx]], [[Smith]], [[Ricardo]]
"If commodities could speak, the would say this: our use value  may interest men, but it does not belong to us as objects. What does belong to us as objects, however, is our value. Our own intercourse as commodities proves it." [[Capital Volume I]], 176-177

Value is produced by socially necessary labor over time

Labor Power = human produced mental or physical movement

## **Use Value vs Exchange Value vs Value Simpliciter**
An object has both a use value (U-V) and a exchange value (E-V), and sometimes value simpliciter (V)

### Use Value
The U-V is the actual value of the object, exemplified either by its us or consumption by humans. 
	The U-V will also never change unless the U-V of  the object it is being compared to changes. 
	Something can have a U-V without value simpliciter such as air, river water, or virgin soil
	A chair could have the use value of 1/4 a table, but it can be exchanged for whatever price the market demands. The utility of the chair is not altered based on its exchange. 
		[[Capital Volume I]], 127-129 

### Exchange Value
The E-V is the value an object is exchanged for in the market.

### Value
Value is socially average unit of time of socially necessary labor power. 
Socially necessary L-P / Î¼ Hours
This also means that mere exchange of commodities will never create value. 
	An example!
		If currently 20 yards of linen takes the same amount of labor power to make as one coat, they are equal. It would be fair to trade them. If it were the case that a new technology developed such that it became 2x faster to make 20 yards of linen, the cost of the coat (relative to the linen would double). Now 40 yards of linen = 1 coat.
			As this can be applied to all objects, every other commodity becomes a mirror of the coat's value ([[Capital Volume I]], 155)
- "Now we know the *substance* of value. It is labor. We know the *measure of its magnitude*. It is labor-time"
	[[Capital Volume I]], 131
- "Equal quantities of labor, at all times and places, must have the same value for the laborer"
	Cited in [[Capital Volume I]] 137

#### Ok.... Now how is the *value* of a product determined?
Value is created IFF **Workers** use the **MoP** on **Materials**
- Note that in this formula, capitalists play no part in the creation of value. They do not work. 

##### Labor power 
is determined by the LTV still
Sustenance (food, water, housing, etc) and education are considered as resources that need to be accounted for in the calculation of how much labor power is worth.
	Think of the worker like a machine: the amount of resources it takes to make the machine and the amount of repairs it needs are crucial calculating the total cost (and total value) of the machine.
		- The buyer of labor is defined as a "capitalist"
		- The seller of labor is defined as a "proletariat"

##### Means of Production (MoP)
The MoP are the tools the workers use to make commodities.
	Examples: the printing press of the publishing house, the espresso machine of the coffee shop, the hammer of the carpentry firm.
	Just like a worker, MoP are destined to deccay without upkeep: the cost of their upkeep must be calculated when searching for its true value.
		If a machine lasts 1 month (for example) the value of the machine is dispersed into its products. If it helps to make 30 things, each of those 30 things increases in value by 1/30.

##### Resources /  Materials
The resources or raw materials are the things acted upon to make commodities.
	Examples: Yeast in a bakery, paper in a publishing house, coffee beans in a coffee shop, wood in a carpentry firm
	These products can then be used as **Materials** in the production of more complex commodities (e.g. grapes being used as material for wine)
		The value of the produced resources must be calculated with the final valor
