[[Capital Volume I]] 160 - 

#### Form A: 
20 yards of linen = 1 coat
	[[Capital Volume I]] 160-163

#### Form B
20 yards of linen = 1 coat
20 yards of linen = 1/2 chair
20 yards of linen = 10lb. tea
etc., etc.

#### Form C
20 yards of linen = X of any Y
(linen here becomes currency, it has obtained the universal equivalent form)

#### Form D
20 yards of linen has become socially accustomed to be synonymous with value. Form D is identical to Form C, it just appears different to the public.

### Currency!
Money (as in, say, the US Dollar) is thus not only a mere product of labor, nor a mere commodity, but a currency. MONEY IS A COMMODITY. 
Money fetishism is a form of [[Commodity Fetishism]].

## Currency Exchange
### C - M - C
In exchange, commodities are exchanged for money which is exchanged for commodities, continuing the cycle ad infinitum
-- This process defines *all* circulation of goods and services --

#### C - M
The **first** metamorphosis of commodity
When a commodity is exchanged for money, it is exchanged for the universal shape of its own value. The buyer gets the use value.
	[[Marx]] calls this the *salto mortale* on the part of the seller.

#### M - C
The **second** metamorphosis of the commodity
Now that the seller has money from selling the initial commodity, they become a buyer.

Nothing could be more foolish than the dogma tat because every sale is a purchase, and every purchase a sale, the circulation of commodities necessarily implies an equilibrium between sales and purchases" [[Capital Volume I]] 208

## To Capital!

While the form of commodity exchange is the formula C-M-C, the primary form of capital is M-C-M.

#### M-C-M
While C- M - C's main goal is to use currency as a means to get use value from a commodity, M -C - M is used to gain exchange value from a commodity. 

#### M-C-M'
##### And the creation of *surplus value*
The milking of exchange value from the form M-C-M turns into the formula M-C-M'. The increase from M to M' is called *surplus value.* This creation of surplus value is the backbone of Capital, and is what allows capitalism to flourish.
	M' = M + Î”M

There are two types of Capital
	Constant Capital capital which is advanced to replace the cost of the means of production
	Variable Capital: Capital that is advanced to replace (and exploit) labor. Variable capital is where surplus value comes from. 

##### So where exactly does surplus value come from?
Surplus Value (S-V) comes from workers laboring for more hours than is socially necessary. S-V is objectified surplus labor time. 

Here's a diagram :)
~~~
1. A-------B--C
2. A-------B----C
3. A-------B-------C

Vector A-C represents the working day of a laborer.
Vector A-B represents the length of socially necessary labor power.
Vector B-C represents the surplus labor time extracted by the capitalist.
~~~

The larger the B-C is, the greater the exploitation is. 
ALL of the production that occurs between B-C is not for the sake of the worker, all of the value instead goes to capitalists. The first vector has less exploitation than the third.
	If AB = BC (like in working day 3), then the rate of exploitation is 100%.

Two types of surplus value:
	Absolute S-V: Surplus value created by lengthening the working day
		Scamming Workers
	Relative S-V: Surplus value created by decreasing the quality of the product
		Scalping, Manipulation, Advertisement, Scamming Customers
Either way, wherer S-V is relative or absolute, a profit is made by decreasing the L-T of the final profuvt.
