## What is EoS?
Manufacturing exists in one of two modes:
	1. Division of Labor (/)
		Independent craftsmen specializing in certain tasks working in divided labor under one capitalist
	2. Atomization (+)
		A capitalist hires one or two people to make a commodity from scratch
Thus, on one hand, manufacture with either introduce division of labor (DoL) into production (1) or combine formerly separate commodities into new ones (2)

Since increasing division of labor creates more value as per the principles of [[Economies of Scale]], there is direct incentive to split jobs ad infinitum to make each worker more and more specialized. It is incredibly efficient.
	The advance of [[Colonialism]] and [[Neocolonialism]] further drive a wedge into workers, further dividing specialization of labor.

-- Effects of Division of Labor on workers can be found in [[Economic Alienation]]. -- 

## How Do EoS Form?
[[Marx]] "A room where twenty weavers work at twenty looms must be larger than the room of a single weaver with two assistants. But it costs less labor to build one workshop for twenty persons than to build ten to accommodate two weavers each; thus the value of the MoP concentrated for use in common on a large scale does not increase in direct proportion to their extent and useful effect... Owing to this, the value of a part of the constant capital falls, and, in proportion to the size of this fall, the total value of the commodity also falls." [[Capital Volume I]], 442
"The object of labor is carried over the same distance in a shorter time." [[Capital Volume I]], 445
