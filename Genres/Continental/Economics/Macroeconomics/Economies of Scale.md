## How Do EoS Form?
[[Marx]] "A room where twenty weavers work at twenty looms must be larger than the room of a single weaver with two assistants. But it costs less labor to build one workshop for twenty persons than to build ten to accomodate two eavers each; thus the value of the MoP concentrated for use in common on a large scale does not increase in direct proportion to their extent and useful effect... OWing to this, the value of a part of the concstant capital falls, and, in proportion to the size of this fall, the total value of the commodity also falls." [[Capital Volume I]], 442
"The object of labor is carried over the same distance in a shorter time." [[Capital Volume I]], 445
