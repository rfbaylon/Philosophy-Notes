[[Destiny]]: Politics is downstream from Ethics
	First you discover a metaphysics
	Then you divine ethical prinicples
	Then you apply these principles among other people and society, creating politics
Politics under this view is synonymous with applied ethics

[[Sidgwick]] 
Ethics is the discussion of what ought to be done by individuals, politics discusses what ought to be done by institutions
	From this, it is not obvious that politics is a branch of ethics, in a similar way its not obvious sailing is a branch of ethics, as they both construct technical imperitives rather than prudential imperitives (To see definitions, see [[Categorical Imperative]])
		A2: What is the goal of government if not to satiate the will of the people?
		A2: what do we build policy on if not morality?
