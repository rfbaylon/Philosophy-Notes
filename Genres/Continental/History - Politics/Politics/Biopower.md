# Biopower
AKA Juridicial Power
See [[Foucault]], [[Butler]]

"It would be wrong to say that the soul is an illusion, or an ideological effect. On the contray, it exists,  it has a reality, it is produced permanently  around, on, within, the body by the functioning of a power that is exercised on those that are punished" [[Discipline and Punish]]
	Similar to [[Deleuze]] & [[Guattari]]'s conception of a BwO

## Formation of the Subject of Power
People play into and reify certain structures of power and the power in turn reifies the categorizations placed on the subject


### As it relates to Feminism
"Juridical power inevitably "produces" what it claims to represent... The Feminist critique ought also to understand how the category of "women," the subject of feminism, is produced and restrained by the very structures of power through which emancipation is sought." [[Gender Trouble]], 5
	[[Butler]] argues that the strict classification of women under bioessentialist lines reinforces the system of power feminism seeks to escape from.

##### [[Irigaray]]
Women are the "other-men" The afterthought of masculinity. There are men, and there are not-men
	"A woman is not the sex she is designated to be, but, rather, the masculine sex *encore*" [[Gender Trouble]], 18

##### [[Foucault]]
Sex, whether masculine or feminine, is the production of regulatory biopower concerning sexuality.
"Sexuality produces sex as an artificial concept which extends power relations responsible for its genesis" [[Gender Trouble]], 117
	In other words, the classification of sexuality itself is what gives power to sex
		"Where feminist analysis takes teh category of sex and the binary restriction on gender as its point of departure, Foucalut understands his own project to be an inquiry into how the category of "sex" and sexual difference are constructed within discourse as necessary features of identity... To be sexed is to be subjected to a set of social regulations." [[Gender Trouble]], 122
		Foucalt wants to focus not on a liberatory homosexuality, but instead on a negative freedom *from* heterosexuality

##### [[Wittig]]
The category of sex is always feminine, as masculinity is the unmarked property, and feminimity is the marked group
	"The masculine is not the masculine, but the general" [[Gender Trouble]], 27
	""Masculine"" and "feminine," "male" and "female" exist *only* within the heterosexual matrix; indeed, they are the naturalized terms that keep the matrix concealed and, hence, protected from a radical critique." [[Gender Trouble]], 141
Wittig also holds that
