## Non-economic forms of State Oppression
### Argument from Beaurocracy
[[Stirner]]: Bureaucracy is a form of non-economic state oppression
	Juxtaposed to classical [[Marx]]ism that states that the state is reducible to economic forces
[[Bakunin]] and [[Kropotkin]] also thought it was incredibly reductive to solely use a class based lens to analayze the state

“It is not the State that presupposes a mode of production; quite the opposite, it is the State that makes productions a ‘mode’” ([[Anti-Oedipus]], 429) #Quote 

# Statism
See [[Marx]]

### [[Marx]]'s Argument from Necessity
"All directly social or communal labor on a large scale requires, to a greater or lesser degree, a directing authority, in order to secure harmonious cooperation og the activityes of individuals" [[Capital Volume I]], 449
	[[Marx]] argues that currently Capital fills this role, but hopefully a state will fill in for it post-revolution
