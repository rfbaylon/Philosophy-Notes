# A2 Psychoanalysis

### Psychoanalysis is Anti-[[Empiricism]]
See [[Bergson]]
A painter substitutes the real image of Notre Dame in order to capture a schema of what it looked like to him. He takes the building out of context of the greater city, of the faults it may appear to have, and out of the time it existed in. The painting is a reconstruction of the reality of Notre Dame from one point of view. Metaphysicians do the same with Platonic concepts... "At most the psychoanalyst will take note of the palce the rubric "Ego" on these states in saying they are "states of ego," just as the painter writes the word "Paris" on each of his sketches. ([[Introduction to Metaphysics]], 28-29)"
