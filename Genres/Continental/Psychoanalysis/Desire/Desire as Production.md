### Postitive Argument for Productive Desire

### Negative Argument Against Desire from Lack
[[Deleuze]] & [[Guattari]]
A lack of something is self contradictory: If a subject feels a lack of some thing, there is a postive feeling there of an existent object that is not there. Thus, the world (as it exists, given desire as lack) does not contain every real object. This seems to be a contradiction.
	"every time the emphasis is put on a lack that desire supposedly suffers from as a way of defining its object, "the world acquires as its double some other sort of world, in accordance with the following line of argument: there is an object that desire feels the lack of; hence the world does not contain each and every object that exists; there is at least one object missing, the one that desire feels the lack of; hence there exists some other place that contains the key to desire (missing in this world)." [[Anti-Oedipus]] 26

Desire does NOT lack an object, it lacks a fixed subject. [[Anti-Oedipus]], 26
