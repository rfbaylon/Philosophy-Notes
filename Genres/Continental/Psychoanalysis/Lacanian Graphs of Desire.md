Graphs and explanations come from [[The Sublime Object of Ideology]], 

A base level of knowledge of [[The Semiotic Chain]] is necessary to understand this.

### Step 1
S
	The floating signifier
S'
	Series of the signifier
Δ
	Presymbolic Intention
$
	Split subject; The lack of signifier; an empty space in the signifier's network
Point de Capiton
	- The point by which the subject is sewn to the signifier, making the individual a subject
	- It is the point of quilting the signified with the signifier. It *defines* the signifier

### Step 2
O
	The Big Other
	"The locus of the treasure trove of signifiers"
s(O)
	A moment, rather than a space (which the Big Other would be)
	The Big Other in action through an agent
I(O)
	- Stands for "symbolic identification"
	- I(O) is the product of the subject piercing the signifying chain
	- It is the image of/ from the Other
	- The Ego-Ideal
		- The point from which the Ideal-ego gains value /  becomes desirable
i(o)
	imaginary other
	It is the image of/ from the other
	-The Ideal-ego
		- The person one identifies with as who they would like to be
e
	imaginary ego
Voice
	- A meaningless object (as opposed to the platitudinous [[Derrida]]n conception)
	-  Voice = Signifier - Quilting
	- Think of it in the same way that repeting a word over and over again forces it to lose meaning: Voice is the physical exhertion of the word with none of the meaning

The journey of a signified and signifier
	Ex. Floating signifiers (S) (such as 'peace,' 'justice,' and 'freedom') attach themselves to a metanarrative (aka presymbolic signified; Δ) called 'Communism' which determines their meaning in relation to communism.  Freedom, now that it has gained a presymbolic signified (Δ) at the Point de Capiton, retroactively defines "freedom" under a communist lens (overthrowing the bourgeoise, unionizing, shedding of alienation). When the floating signifier 'freedom' is quilted at the Point de Capiton under a Liberal metanarrative, the floating signifier "freedom" gains a new definition.

## Step 2:

Journey of the Barred Subject ($) to the I(O)
	[[Freud]]'s story of little Hans [(A Tour of Lacan's Graph of Desire, 22:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67d0aGc9K_I)
		A baby ($) is born into the world, and a few years later his mother (s(O)) is bathing him. Hans notices that his mother wont touch his penis and asks 
			"why wont you put your finger there?"
			Mother: "Because that would be piggish"
			Hans: "Whats that? Piggish? Why?"
			Mother: "Because it is not proper"
		The barred subject encounters the coding of the Big Other (that it would be piggish to touch his penis), enforced by the s(O) or the moment of the Big Other embodied by his mother. The subject ($) thus becomes a moment of the Big Other (s(O)) himself later in time.
