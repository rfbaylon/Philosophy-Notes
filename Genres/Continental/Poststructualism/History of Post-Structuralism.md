### Environment

The dissolution of the barrier between man and nature (a presupposed maxim of modernism) is what leads to postmodernism. Specifically, the movement from the word "nature" to "environment."
	Coincidentally, this also happens to be the same time [[Baudrillard]] claims we entered the postmodern era. 
	"[[Jameson]] argued that the disappearance of nature was a necessary precondition for the emergence of the postmodern mentality. "Postmodernism is what you have," he asserted, "when the modernization process is complete and nature is gone for good...Nature in that sense, he is saying, is gone for good because it epitomizes the age-old illusion that it is possible to arrive at a direct, wholly reliable relation with material reality."
