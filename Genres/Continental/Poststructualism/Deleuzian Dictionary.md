### Machine
Anything that produces intensities and flows; anything with affectual power
	This definition means everything is a machine

### Assemblages

Each assemblage has both content and expression
	Content: The machinic assemblage of bodies; the assemblage in itself 
	Expression: The collective assemblage of enunciation of the assemblage; the way it is sensed by other machines
		This discussion is reminiscent of [[Whitehead]]'s theory of an actual entity, and the datum of said entity realized in another actual entity.

Each assemblage has a side of territorialization and deterritorialization
	Territorial: Stabilization of the assemblage; states that affirm the will to power of the assemblage
	Deterritorial: Destabilization of the assemblage; machines that undermine the will to power of the assemblage

[[Kafka]] is said to be incredible at not only differentiating the poles of these axes, but making a synthesis from them in a minor language. [[A Thousand Plateaus]], 88

### Desiring Machine
Machines that produce desire for certain objects. 
	As opposed to [[Lacan]] or [[Freud]], desire is positive (creative) rather than negative (defined as a lack). 

### Coding / Decoding / Overcoding

### Body Without Organs
A blank surface without intensities or flows upon which machines attatch themself. 
	An empty field is a perfect example. Entirely unyielding in crops and nonproductive until seeds are planted in the soil. The seeds are the productive part of the farm (the body now with organs) that attatch themselves to the nonproductive canvas of the soil.

Mediator between subconscious and conscious, Reality checks and checks identity.
