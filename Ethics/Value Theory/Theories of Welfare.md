Y = Theory matches common judgement
N = Theory conflicts with common judgement
? = Theory is compatible with either judgement

Hugh = Hugh is the archetypial rock and roller, lots of sex, drugs, and concerts. He loves it.
Stoicus = Stoicus loves deep meditation, and spends most of his time in a sensory deprivation tank. He loves it.
Hughicus = Stoicus with his desires living in Hugh's body
Experience Machine = 
Crap Tech = Experience Machine, but downgraded. It is just your entire life spent in Experience Machine as it would have been *except* for one instance of a stubbed toe not happening.
True Friends = Ryan and Schmyan both experience the same life filled with good friends. Ryan actually has good friends that love them, but Schmyan's friends secretly hate them and talk behind their back.
Bad desires = A seagull wants to eat trash, but it will kill her. She doesnt have long term health goals either.
Plant = Setting a fern on fire.
## Mentalistic
Sensory Hedonism: + Pleasure / - Pain
Attitudinal Hedonism: + Enjoyment / - Suffering

Most serious mentalists are attitudinal hedonists. The difference is attitudinal hedonism allows for masochism or running to be pleasant, even though they cause pain. Pain isn't necessarily suffering.

Actual Satisfaction: + Desires fulfilled/ - Desires frustrated

## Objective List
### Aristotle
#### Happiness is *not*:
* Not pleasure. The life of pleasure is “completely slavish... a life for grazing animals” (1.5.2-30). 
* Not honor. Honor depends on other people honoring you, but the best good is “something of our own and hard to take from us” (1.5.4-5).
* Not money. “... clearly wealth is not the good we are seeking, since it is [merely] useful, [choiceworthy only] for some other end” (1.5.8).
* Not virtue. “... it seems possible for someone to possess virtue but be asleep or inactive throughout his life... If this is the sort of life he leads, no one would count him happy” (1.5.6).
#### Happiness *is*
Happiness is the function of man.
	1097b2-21
A happy man is who exercises eternal goods + virtue + time + according death. 
	The practice is incredibly important. "Just as the Olympic Games it is not the best looking or strongest men present that are crowned, but the competitors" 
		[[Nichomachean Ethics]] 1098b12-1099a7
	"We are now in a position to define the happy man as 'one who is active in accordance with complete virtue and who is adequately furnished with external goods, and that not for some unspecified period but throughout a complete life... and die accordingly" 
		[[Nichomachean Ethics]], 1100b27-1101a20

"Happiness demands not only complete goodness, but complete life"
	[[Nichomachean Ethics]] 1099b21-1100a9

Ok, so what does that look like in practice??
	Contemplation!!!

### Argument from Most Complete

(i) Happiness is “complete without qualification.” We choose it because of itself, never because of something else (1097b1-2).
(ii) We choose to do character virtuous actions for the sake of other things beyond the actions themselves (even though, when virtuous, we also choose them for the sake of themselves, too). For instance, we act generously to gain friends, we act bravely to defend our city, we act temperately to be fully rested for the next day, etc.
(iii) In contrast, we do not choose to study for the sake of other things (“study seems to be liked because of itself alone”).
(iv) So, happiness is studying.
### Argument from Self Suffecient

(i) Happiness is self-sufficient—that is, “all by itself it makes a life choiceworthy and lacking nothing” (1097b15-17). 
(ii) Well, actually, happiness is whatever is most self-sufficient (1177a1-2).
(iii) Now, to perform any virtuous action (including studying), one needs to have the necessary goods—food, water, shelter, etc.
(iv) But to perform character virtuous actions—that is, to act justly, generously, temperately, bravely, etc.—one needs more than one needs to study. For example, one needs other people “as partners and recipients” of these actions.
(v) Studying, however, can be done on its own (even though it’s often done better with friends).
(vi) So, of all virtuous actions, studying is most self-sufficient. You need less to do it.
(vii) So, happiness is studying.

### Argument  from Leisure
(i) Happiness is virtuous activity that is done in leisure.
(ii) We do character virtuous actions when we are not at leisure. We do them when engaged in politics or war, for instance. Moreover, we do character virtuous actions for the sake of attaining leisure (for the sake of winning peace, say).
(iii) In contrast, we study at leisure.
(iv) Further, studying is the only virtuous activity that is done at leisure.
(v) So, happiness is studying.

### Argument from Identity
(i) What each person is is their “controlling and better element.”
(ii) Each person’s controlling and better element is their understanding.
(iii) Happiness is the activity of oneself.
(iv) So, happiness is the activity of one’s understanding (since one is one’s understanding).
(v) The activity of one’s understanding is studying. 
(vi) So, happiness is studying.

### Argument from Most Pleasure
(i) Happiness is pleasurable (“pleasure must be mixed into happiness”).
(ii) So, it’s fitting that the activity that is happiness is the most pleasurable of the activities in accord with virtue (since, at this point, we’re only considering those activities; see Function Argument).
(iii) The most pleasurable of the activities in accord with virtue is studying.
(iv) So, happiness is studying.

### Argument from Most Continous Activity
(i) The activity that is happiness is the activity that is most “unwearied” (1177b23)—that is, it is the sort of activity that a human can do most continuously without becoming tired.
(ii) The most unwearied (or continuous) activity is study.
(iii) So, happiness is studying.

### Argument from Gods
(i) Happiness is an activity.
(ii) The gods are happy.
(iii) The gods do not engage in character virtuous actions (they don’t go around acting bravely, temperately, justly, etc.). Nor do they engage in the crafts. Both of these are beneath them.
(iv) So, they must engage in studying, since this is the only other virtuous activity available.
(v) So, happiness is studying.
