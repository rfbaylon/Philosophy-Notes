### Aristotle
Things are good in as many senses as they are said to exist. Something is good in substance (eg god or mind) and in quality (virtues) and quantity (moderation) relation (what is useful), and in place (habitat).
	[[Nichomachean Ethics]], 1096a19-b6
	ie., things are only good qua other things.
