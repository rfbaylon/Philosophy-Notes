### Pleasure and Pain are Asymmetrical
See [[Benatar]]
#### Extreme Asymmetry
Pain counts against an outcome, but pleasure does not count in its favor
	A2: Thus, there is no reason to make actually existing beings happy. There is no reason for me to pursue a good life. [[Singer On Killing Animals]]
#### Moderate Asymmetry
See [[Benatar]]
Pleasure and Pain count for inevitable, only pain counts for contingents
	A2: Thus, one acts wrongly by bringing a being into this world who lives a generally happy life, but suffers at least one moment in their life. [[Singer On Killing Animals]]
#### Impure Asymmetry
Pleasure and pain count for all actual beings, only pain counts for nonactual contingents
	A2: If I create a being with a pleasant life, that is permissible, but if I do not create a being with a pleasant life, it would have been wrong to create it. This is a paradox [[Singer On Killing Animals]]
#### Offsetting Asymmetry
Pleasure can offset pain, but pleasure can never count in itself. There would be no reason to promote an outcome with pleasure but no pain
	A2: Thus, there is no reason to make actually existing beings happy. There is no reason for me to pursue a good life. [[Singer On Killing Animals]]
	A2: This one especially seems ad hoc
#### Impure Offsetting Asymmetry
Pleasure can offset pain, but pleasure can never count in itself, unless for actual beings. In that case, there would be reason to promote a pleasurable outcome, but only for actual beings.
	A2: Ad hoc as fuck bro. Why would asymmetry hold only for nonactual contingents? Where did this line come from? [[Singer On Killing Animals]]

### A2 Asymmetry
General A2: [[Kagan]] [[Singer]]
	Most of the Asymmetry views tend to be ad hoc [[Fallacy]]. In other words, they all seem to have been motivated because many people did not like the implications of the symmetrical worldviews. Its a cope. 

### A2 Asymmetry
See [[Kagan]], [[Singer]]
See [[Population Ethics]]: Total View, Prior Existence View, and Actualist View are all prima facie symmetrical
