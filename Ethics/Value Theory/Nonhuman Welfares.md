# Plants

Angela Kallhoff has listed three conditions for plant flourishing which together constitute a description of the good life for plants. These are: 
1. the ability to react ‘to external stress without endangering the overall performance which sustains its life’; 
2. the ability to accomplish its life- cycle; 
3. succeeding ‘in expressing the typical characteristics both of a plant which has specific life- form and of more specific organisms, generally fitting its species description’ (2014, p. 687).

Etiological Account of Telological Welfare
[[Basl]]

"Something, X, is good for nonsentient organism O if and only if it promotes one of O's ends. X is bad for O if and only if it frustrates one of O's ends. O has E as an end if and only if there was a selection for E at the level of individual organisms in the ancestral population of which O is a descendent"

		If a plant identical to a orchid popped into existence, then this account would claim that this plant does not have welfare, despite it being the same as a plant thats created exactly the same way.

# Animals
Veit and Browning (2016) defend three different kinds of animal welfare
- Affective
- Physical
- "Natural Living"

### Natural Living
Weirdly, [[Dewey]] proposes a good articulation of this:
"Experience is a matter of the interaction of organism with its environment, an environment that is human as well as physical, that includes the materials of tradition and instructions as well as local surroundings The organism brings with it through its own structure, native and aquired, forces that play a part in the interaction. The self acts as well as undergoes, and its undergoings are not impressions stamped upon an inert wax (A2 [[Descartes]]) but depend  upon the way the organism reacts and responds. There is no experience in which the human (or animal) contribution  is not a factor in determining what actually happens. The organism is a force, not a transparency"

"Our needs are drafts drawn upon the environment, at first blindly, then with conscious interest and attention"
