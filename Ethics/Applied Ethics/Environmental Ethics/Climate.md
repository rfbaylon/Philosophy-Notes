### Climatological Supremacy as Racial Supremacy
See [[Hulme]]
See [[Nature (Metaphysics)]]
Ancient Greeks believed their climate to be perfect, and thus their culture was perfect compared to the hostile other lands. The idea of climatological supremacy was tied with racial supremacy. This expectation of what weather should be is a claim from the socially defined nature of weather. ([[Hulme]], 2011)
