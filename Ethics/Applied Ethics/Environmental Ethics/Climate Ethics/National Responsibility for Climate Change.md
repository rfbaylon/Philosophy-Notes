# Per Capita or Aggregate?

## Per Capita
Everyone is entitled to the same amount of atmosphere, nobody's amount should be more than another's.
Borders are arbitrary anyways when dealing with a global problem like this.

## Aggregate

# How do we Split?

## Historical Responsibility
"You broke it, you fix it"
The country that has produced the most emissions historically ought to rectify it up to the point in which they were responsible [[Practical Ethics]], 220
	A2: Shouldn't we only hold people accountable for what they knew they were doing? People in the 1800s had no clue what climate change was, so they cant be held responsible
		A2A2: If a factory unknowingly pollutes a river, they are still responsible to clean it up. Who else would be? Another example could be a person tipping over an expensive vase in an antique store. Even though it wasn't your *fault* it is still your responsibility.

## Equal Shares
Everyone gets 2 tons CO2 per year to emit. You can buy or sell your carbon allowance according to need, but you cant go above [[Practical Ethics]],  223
This will allow for a cap and trade system that will bring up poor nations (in effect promoting a solution to [[Global Poverty]]) and take rich nations down based on allowance
	A2: How does this get enforced?
	A2: Who pays for *past* damage?
	A2: A carbon tax could be better, we need more data.
