 "Here’s the problem. The total quantity of animal suffering caused by the meat industry is so unbelievably, insanely, astronomically huge that even on the above assumptions, the meat industry is still the worst thing in the world by far – it’s still going to be orders of magnitude worse than any other problem that people talk about. The number of land animals slaughtered for food worldwide, per year, is estimated between 40 and 60 billion. (If you include sea creatures, closer to 150 billion.) Almost all of them suffered enormously on factory farms, in conditions that we would certainly call “torture” if they were imposed on any person. For simplicity, let’s take the number to be 50 billion. That is seven times larger than the entire human population of the world. Obviously, if 50 billion people were subjected to torture on an ongoing basis, that would be the worst problem in the world. But now, we’re assuming that suffering by farm animals is only one tenth as bad as human suffering, because farm animals are so much less intelligent than humans. So the problem is really “only” as bad as the situation if 5 billion people were being tortured on a regular basis. Still the worst problem in the world, by far. Okay, what if you hold a really extreme view: the suffering of a cow is only 1/100 as bad as similar suffering for a human, because humans are so smart. In that case, the factory farming situation is “only” as bad as having 500 million people subjected to constant torture. What if farm animal pain is only one thousandth as bad as human pain? Then the situation is only as bad as having *50 million* people being tortured in concentration camps. Again, this would still be far and away the worst problem in the world. And that is assuming that you take what seems tome an incredibly, implausibly extreme view about the relative importance of humans compared to animals. What is the worst thing that ever happened in human history? Many people would say it is the Holocaust, during which 11 million people were subjected to severe suffering before being killed, in concentration camps. Animals, however, are regularly subjected to similar (or even more severe) suffering before being killed in factory farms. Suppose that the suffering and death of an average human in an average concentration camp is one thousand times worse than the suffering and death of an average animal in an average farm. In that case, a single year of the meat industry is about five times as bad as the Holocaust. It’s as if we were repeating the Holocaust five times every year. Again, that’s on extremely optimistic assumptions. It might actually be as bad as 500 Holocausts per year."

### AnAg contributes to a lot of climate change
"When you put these figures together, the upshot is that industrial animal agriculture is responsible for anywhere from 18-51% global greenhouse gas emissions. Why is this range report12 so wide? The 18% figure comes from a 2006 FAO whereas the 51% figure comes report13, from a 2009 World Watch which purports to be less conservative and more comprehensive than the FAO report in several ways. For example, the World Watch report estimates that the global population of farmed animals is higher than the FAO report does, and it also considers a wider range of food-related activities as part of industrial animal agriculture than the FAO report does."
