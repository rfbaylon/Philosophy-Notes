[[Donaldson]] and [[Kymlicka]]

Copy/pasted from [[Citizenship]]
```
[[Donaldson]] and [[Kymlicka]] argue that too much focus is on the third function (a la [[Rawls]] and [[Habermas]]), but it discludes infants, disabled people, and animals. But on top of this, a lot of the disability movement has focused on "Nothing about us without us," bucking the old paternalistic model. In order for many to make these decisions though, they require some sort of assisted autonomy. "In other words, political agency, should be seen as something that inheres in a relationship amongst citizens, not as an attribute of individuals that exists prior to their interaction. It is not that people are first agents and *therefore* accorded citizenship"

[[Donaldson]] and [[Kymlicka]] argue that a similar argument from [[Politics of Disability]] could also apply to urban and domesticated animals
