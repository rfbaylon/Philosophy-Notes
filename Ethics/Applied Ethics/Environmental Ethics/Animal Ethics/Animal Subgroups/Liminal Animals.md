"The simplistic dichotomy of wild and domestic animals-- and the accompanying call to simply 'let animals be'-- needs to be replaced with a more complex matrix of relationships and a more complex set of moral prescriptions"

Dependence (and perhaps wildness generally) can be cached out in a few ways:
- Johnny's pet mouse is dependent in that she is *inflexibly* and *specifically* dependent. Inflexibly, because she cant leave and specifically because she depends on one specific person, Johnny.
- A rat that lives in the dump is dependent on humans, but in a different way. She is able to move and not dependent on any one particular human.
