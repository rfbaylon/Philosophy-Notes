What do we owe nonhuman animals that have been harmed by human action?

# Empirics


### No Positive Evidence
There is not much positive evidence that animal research offers a net benefit to humans
	(Necessary Conditions for Morally Responsible Animal Research)

### Counterfactuals
An analysis cannot look towards past things solved by animal research, but needs to look counterfactually
	(Necessary Conditions for Morally Responsible Animal Research)

### New Tech Complicates
We have incredible new tech (computer modeling and stem cell models) that further complicates positive analysis
	(Necessary Conditions for Morally Responsible Animal Research)

### Animal Research Harms Humans
1.  It costs a lot of money to research
2.  There are false toxicity positives, false toxicity negatives, false efficacy positives, and false efficacy negatives
	(Necessary Conditions for Morally Responsible Animal Research)

### DeGrazia and Sebo
**DeGrazia and Sebo’s Minimal Conditions for Animal Testing**
1. *Expectation of net benefit*  
   1. **Ex**. 50 sheep to cure cancer vs 1 sheep tased to see muscle movements  
   2. **Why?** In other words, it's wrong to hurt people / animals for no reason.   
2. *Subjects need to have a life worth living*  
   1. **Ex.** This includes good housing for subjects, proper nutrition, socialization, etc for subjects where it is applicable.  
   2. **Why?** This is because whether human or nonhuman, it is wrong to intentionally bring a miserable life into the world.   
   3. **Why?** This is also because we create special obligations to their kids by creating them, similar to how parents create special obligations to their kids by creating them  
3. *Subjects need to endure no unnecessary harm*  
   1. **Ex.** If you are doing a study on the enzymes active in the stomach of an animal as it could cure anemia, then the lack of food is essential to the research goal. It would then be justified. 
   2. **Why?** As soon as we take animals as beings worthy of respect, unnecessary harm is a bare minimum standard.   
   3. **Why?** In the same way the lack of reason for kicking stray dogs is wrong, starving/confining/otherwise depriving basic needs for no (research-related) reason is wrong

## Retired Animals

#### Chimps 
#ethics-bowl 

P1 Chimps are beings that can be victims
P2 The chimps in this case were victims of the US Government
P3 Where harm is done to victims, perpetrators have a duty to remedy the harm as best as possible
P4 The US Government has a duty to remedy the harm as best as possible

By US law, retired research chimps may only be moved to federally funded chimp sanctuaries. At time of writing, there is only one (Chimp Haven)

*Chimp Haven has capacity for a total of 230 animals, and as of 1 January, is home to 225 chimps. But the NIH still has 288 chimps in labs.*
	https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-01324-7

*It costs about $24,000 per chimpanzee annually to provide care at sanctuary. This includes their food, medical care, enrichment and all of the basic necessities for these extraordinary individuals.*
	https://chimphaven.org/about-us/

*Chimp Haven is a private, nonprofit organization that depends significantly on the generosity of individuals to help cover the cost of chimpanzee care. Chimp Haven receives government funding (75 percent) to support the care of federally-owned chimpanzees, and must raise the remaining 25 percent of funds for the chimpanzees’ care through private support.*
	https://chimphaven.org/about-us/

*"If you look at the medical summaries for some of the chimps, a lot of them will say, 'Well, we're concerned that there'll be a sudden heart attack if the chimps are moved,'" says [Kathleen Conlee](https://www.humanesociety.org/news/animal-researcher-animal-advocate), vice president of animal research issues at the Humane Society of the United States. "Chimpanzees are notorious for cardiac problems anyway. You could be a completely healthy chimpanzee at 16 years old and die from a heart attack, quite frankly. So to us, that's not a reason to keep them sitting in the labs."*

*The cost for the NIH to support a chimp's care at Chimp Haven is significantly cheaper than at research facilities, Conlee points out, as the sanctuary is required to raise some of its own funds. The average [cost](https://orip.nih.gov/comparative-medicine/programs/vertebrate-models/chimpanzee-management-reports) to the NIH is around $26 per animal per day at the sanctuary, compared with around $97 or $124 per day at a research facility.*

*A U.S. federal judge has ruled against the nation’s largest biomedical agency in a long-running battle over the fate of dozens of former research chimpanzees. On Tuesday, a Maryland court declared that the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) violated federal law by not moving the animals out of biomedical facilities to a government sanctuary. The ruling could force the agency to transfer the great apes, though the details remain to be worked out.*

	Follows from the letter of the law layer out in the CHIMP act (thats actually what its called)
	*[CHIMP] also mandated the retirement of NIH-owned chimps no longer needed in biomedical research: “All surplus chimpanzees owned by the Federal Government shall be accepted into the sanctuary system.”*

*In December 2011, a [groundbreaking report](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/13257/chimpanzees-in-biomedical-and-behavioral-research-assessing-the-necessity) by the Institute of Medicine and National Research Council found agreement that the vast majority of biomedical and behavioral research on chimpanzees is unnecessary for human health. This report raised but did not address the serious ethical issues inherent in the use of chimpanzees in research.*

*Of the 110 identified projects sponsored by the NIH between 2001 and 2010, 44 were for research on hepatitis; comparative genomics accounted for 13 projects; 11 projects were for neuroscience research; 9 projects were for AIDS/HIV studies; and 7 projects were for behavioral research.
