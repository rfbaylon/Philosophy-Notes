### IPM
IPM (integrated pest management) is a recent philosophy which claims to better control for pests. It rests on 4 pillars.
1. Surveys (mapping, understanding, recording)
2. Tolerance Limit (understanding when something is a threat)
	"From the standpoint of good public health practice, the tolerance limit for rats or mice in human living quarter should be zero; that is, rodents should not live with people."
3. Interventions (actions taken to prevent, reduce, or eliminate rodent infestations)
4. Evaluation (determine the effectiveness of pillars 1-3)
