### IPM
IPM (integrated pest management) is a recent philosophy which claims to better control for pests. It rests on 4 pillars.
1. Surveys (mapping, understanding, recording)
2. Tolerance Limit (understanding when something is a threat)
	"From the standpoint of good public health practice, the tolerance limit for rats or mice in human living quarter should be zero; that is, rodents should not live with people."
3. Interventions (actions taken to prevent, reduce, or eliminate rodent infestations)
4. Evaluation (determine the effectiveness of pillars 1-3)


# Philosophic Case Study: Rats

"The contemporary rat, as interspecies figure knotted up with humans and as living creature, is not just a canary in the coalmine for the Anthropocene that marks the paradoxical triumph of the human; rather, it is the kind of ground on which conditions of awkward life in the Anthropocene are being reworked, in ways both violent and accommodating."
	Interspecies Politics and the Global Rat, 244

"Caring for bees without protective clothing can be a transformative act for committed beekeepers, but also remains to be a poignant reminder of the vulnerability of human bodies. Green and Ginn conclude this can have ethical implications: “becoming less uncomfortable with vulnerability and seeking to put ourselves at risk can be a productive ethical practice. We might learn to accept the risks more, to loosen the hegemonic idea of a self-certain subject to whom an outsider arrives to disrupt.” #Quote

### Impacts to Rats
Both 2nd-generation (brodifacoum, bromodialone, difenacoum and difethialone) and 1st-generation
anticoagulants (warfarin, chlorophacinone, and diphacinone) work by preventing blood clotting. Animals that eat these rodenticides die from internal hemorrhaging (bleeding) within a few days.

Rats die within 5-7 days

The anticoagulant rodenticides [interfere with vitamin K-1 metabolism](https://doi.org/10.1002/ps.2780430112), which interferes with platelet-mediated clotting. Without clotting, the daily wear and tear damage to blood vessels is not repaired, which eventually causes death by blood loss or organ failure due to internal bleeding. This can happen to humans who take the anticoagulant drug warfarin (also a first generation anticoagulant rodenticide) without having their blood clotting carefully monitored– [after ingesting an anticoagulant, simple traumas are more likely to lead to internal bleeding](https://web.archive.org/web/20220425150116/https://www.jems.com/patient-care/risk-internal-bleeding-heightened-antico/), which can can be painful or life-threatening. Bleeding is not usually painful in itself, but the accumulation of blood in closed spaces like the abdomen or around the heart is [likely to be agonizing](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/253097632_The_humaneness_of_rodent_pest_control/stats). Bleeding into the lungs or airways can make breathing difficult and lead to [air hunger](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33577128/) and a feeling of drowning, which, as most humans have some ability to imagine, are highly distressing. [One study](https://doi.org/10.30843/nzpp.2000.53.3701) found that a third of rats poisoned with brodifacoum developed impaired movement followed by paralysis two days before death, and less eating and moving a day before that. Internal bleeding that impairs the function of internal organs can be painful before it is deadly, as humans who have suffered abdominal bleeding describe.

### Secondary Impacts
A summary of exposure data from North America, Europe and New Zealand found that over 58% of nearly 4200 specimens contained one or more AR residues.

80% of eagles have SGARs in system

In nontarget predatory and scavenging birds, exposure to a toxic AR dose typically results in hemorrhage, blood loss anemia, pallor of mucus membranes, depressed mentation and weakness, all of which can lead to death.

The well-developed blood vessels in her oviducts had ruptured, and she had slowly bled to death from the inside.”

### Other Solutions

#### Dry Ice
But the Environmental Protection Agency reached out to state agencies in Illinois, Massachusetts, New York and elsewhere in recent months to make clear that federal guidelines prohibit the use of dry ice for rat abatement because the deadly treatment is not registered with the federal agency as required. The law is in place to ensure products are safe, and directions for use minimize risks to users, the public and the environment.

“We didn’t see this thing as a pesticide by the classic definition, because dry ice is used everywhere,” Christopher said. “You go to a nightclub and they’ll serve cocktails in a bucket of dry ice. This is not necessarily one of those logical things, it’s a regulatory issue, and we’ll respect everything they want us to do.”...
The Boston's legal team is in the process of applying for an EPA permit to restart the program, Christopher said. The city recorded as much as a 95% reduction in rodent activity in areas where it deployed dry ice after it launched the pilot in April....
The city noted that at 50 cents per pound, dry ice is far cheaper than the rat poison pellets selling for $57 per 20-pound bucket.

#### Birth Control
ContraPest, the only EPA-approved rodent birth control, only became available directly to consumers in some U.S. states in 2018.

Wildlife who accidentally ingest these poisons may suffer greatly as well. Predators can ingest many times a fatal dose of rodenticides for their size by eating multiple poisoned rodents and suffer the same agony as the target rodents.  Erin Ryan shares that, in addition to internal bleeding, birds of prey poisoned with rodenticides even at sublethal doses are more likely to be killed by secondary causes, such as being hit by cars.

Newton Uses Contrapest birth control

- In Washington DC, at one site, there was a 94 percent reduction in rat activity and a 98 percent decline in juvenile rats. At the second site, there was a 99 percent reduction in rat activity and 100 percent decline in juvenile rats during the same period.
- The city of San Francisco deployed ContraPest® in parks and saw a 65 percent reduction in rat burrows.
- The City of Hartford began seeing positive results within two months of deployment.
