### Indignity
Pets are 'living artifiacts' whom humans bred to 'docility, tractability, stupidity and dependency'
	[[Callicott]], 1980

We have done pets wrong by bringing them into this world, and it makes no sense to continue producing them as servants, literal *pets*, for human enjotment. 
We have bred them to be compliant and servile, or to have characteristics that are harmful to them but pleasant to us" [[Francione]], 2007, p4
	A2: consider slaves: Justice requires we abolish slavery, *not* that we prevent former slaves from reproducing. [[Zoopolis]] 77
	A2: we dont create pets in a lab! there can be a myriad ways pets can come about, not all of them are gross. Consider a family dog that gets pregnant at the dog park. 
	A2: Animal Rights, at this time, is bolstering the liberal notions of independece as the backbone of a lot of their theory. At the same time, feminists are problematizing this notion. Dependecncy doesnt mean indignacy -- the way we respond to it does. [[Zoopolis]] 83

### Insensitive to Rights
Most claims you make here are incredibly insensitive. Just making sure a child is better off than otherwise or has their bare needs meet doesnt make you a good parent. Same goes for pets.
