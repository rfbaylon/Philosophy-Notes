## Lack of Relationality
[[Donaldson]] and [[Kymlicka]], [[Palmer]]

### Problems with Past Approaches
- Up until Palmer and Zoopolis, nobody has created a robust postitive framework
- There is a historical dichotomy between rights/utilitarian frameworks and relational views
- Appeals in the past have always been towards facts about individual animals, never analyzing them politically/socially

# 20th Century

## Brophy
### The Rights of Animals, 1965

**Main demands:** Treat animals like we treat humans, Treat vegetarianism as an idea seriously (not mere sentimentalism, weakness, or anthropomorphism), Pleasure and pain secondary to rights.

" Still, that proves nothing either way about the validity of our views. It is abnormal to be a lunatic convinced you are Napoleon, but equally (indeed, numerically considered, probably even more) abnormal to be a genius. The test of a view is its rationality, not the number of people who endorse it. It would have been cranky indeed in the ancient world to raise the question of the rights of slaves—so cranky that scarcely a voice went on record as doing so."

## Ryder
### Speciesism, 1970

**Main demands:** Consider animals on a moral spectrum like we view them on a biological spectrum. Consider pleasure and pain, as well as right to life. 'Homo sapien' is morally void.

“Under special laboratory conditions it may soon prove possible to mate a gorilla with a professor of biology. Will the hairy offspring be kept in a cage or a cradle?”

## Oxford Group
Made up of Roslind Godlovich, John Harris and Richard D. Ryder, Stephen Clark, Andrew Linzey and Peter Singer. Very heavily influenced by Brophy.

Ryder was the reason Singer began to take animal ethics seriously

### Animals, Men, Morals (1971)
### Animals' Rights: A Symposium (1979)

## Singer
### Animal Liberation (1975)

**Main demands:** Consider "Homo sapien" morally void

## Year 0
