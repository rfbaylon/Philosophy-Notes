# Politics of Invasion

### Colonial Wilderness
See [[o
The dubbing of some species as invasive is a remnant of Colonial wilderness. 
- Fetishizes an arbitrary “starting point” of nature before humans interfered.
- Ignores that humans have been moving plants and animals around forever.
	- State tree of Hawaii (the Kukui) is “invasive” as it was brought by early Polynesian travellers, but today serves a crucial role in Hawaiian ecosystems and culture.
	- Kiore (Rattus Exulans) were introduced by Maori to what is now New Zealand as culturally and ecologically important.


There are weird lines between what makes something belong vs Invasive. What makes rats invasive, but not feral cats? What makes lanternflies invasive, but not New Zealand hogs? Why aren't industrialized humans invasive? 
(I think) Anthropocentrism is the reason.
The protection of ecosystems is important, but this needs to be cached out in terms of resilience, ecosystem functioning, and biodiversity rather than a “return” to untouched wilderness.


# Case Study: Barred Owls

Barred Owls, traditionally found in the Eastern United States, have been moving Westward since the 60s. The reasons for this move are contested, but there are two main theories:
- The owls naturally moved West
- Climate change, deforestation, and changes in land use drove the owls West
Likely, parts of both are true.

The move threatens the endangered Northern Spotted Owl as Barred Owls are more generalist and aggressive. The Northern Spotted Owl populations have been decreasing rapidly.

In 2015, The US Fish and Wildlife Service began a bounty program to kill 3,135 Barred Owls. They've succeeded.

- The US Fish and Wildlife Service is drafting a plan to kill 500,000 Barred Owls in the Pacific Northwest
