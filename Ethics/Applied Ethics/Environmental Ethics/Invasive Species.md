# Politics of Invasion

### Colonial Wilderness
See [[Wilderness]]
The dubbing of some species as invasive is a remnant of Colonial wilderness. 
- Fetishizes an arbitrary “starting point” of nature before humans interfered.
- Ignores that humans have been moving plants and animals around forever.
	- State tree of Hawaii (the Kukui) is “invasive” as it was brought by early Polynesian travellers, but today serves a crucial role in Hawaiian ecosystems and culture.
	- Kiore (Rattus Exulans) were introduced by Maori to what is now New Zealand as culturally and ecologically important.

### Pest is Political
See [[Pests]]
There are weird lines between what makes something belong vs Invasive. What makes rats invasive, but not feral cats? What makes lanternflies invasive, but not New Zealand hogs? Why aren't industrialized humans invasive? 
It seems that the only animals deemed invasive are the ones that dont directly benefit humans. 

# Case Study: Barred Owls

Barred Owls, traditionally found in the Eastern United States, have been moving Westward since the 60s. The reasons for this move are contested, but there are two main theories:
- The owls naturally moved West
- Climate change, deforestation, and changes in land use drove the owls West
Likely, parts of both are true.

The move threatens the endangered Northern Spotted Owl as Barred Owls are more generalist and aggressive. The Northern Spotted Owl populations have been decreasing rapidly.

In 2015, The US Fish and Wildlife Service began a bounty program to kill 3,135 Barred Owls. They've succeeded.

- The US Fish and Wildlife Service is drafting a plan to kill 500,000 Barred Owls in the Pacific Northwest

 *the dilemma*:
Ecologists claim that the culling of Barred Owls at this scale is the only way to protect the Northern Spotted Owls. Protection of the Old Growths they inhabit have been really good, and Barred Owls are already there.

## For the Slaughter

### Indicator Species
Northern Spotted Owls are important indicator species for the forests themselves. Without them, we would be much worse at protecting the old growth forests. 
## Against the Slaughter

Similar to the famous orchid example mentioned as an A2 [[Deep Ecology]]

Barred Owls and Spotted Owls do create fertile offspring. This ‘dilution’ of the Spotted Owl gene pool counts as making the Spotted Owl extinct, despite the offspring being best adapted to the Pacific Northwest environment.

“The Barred Owl case brings up an uncomfortable fact: Many people see species as having final value, but the border between species can be fuzzy because the term ‘species’ itself has several possible meanings… Ultimately, ‘species’ is a human concept rather than a biological reality”
