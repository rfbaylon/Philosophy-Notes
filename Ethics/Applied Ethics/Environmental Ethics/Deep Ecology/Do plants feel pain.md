Do plants have nociceptive cells and molecular receptors for noxious stimuli such as ASICs (acid sensing ion channels) or TRPs (transient receptor potential channels), the two most frequently occurring nociceptors in animals (Smith and Lewin [2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00709-020-01550-9#ref-CR60))? In regard to nociceptive sensory cells, the answer is definitely no. In regard to the receptor molecules, the answer is most probably not, but one should bear in mind that plants have receptors and ion channels with similarities to the molecular constituents of animal nociceptive systems.

many (Jains) justify plant eating due to the fact that plants were ekendriya jiva, meaning that they only had one sense (touch) compared to the more developed pañcendriya cow, pig, or human who all have five senses (Tähtinen: 37, Laidlaw). [[Jainism]]
