### Deep Ecology is Anthropocentrist
See [[Zizek]]
Deep Ecology is radically anthropocentrist as it values beauty through our eyes and sees us as the agents to help everything. We are deified through deep ecology, reinforcing anthropocentrism.

Deer eat endangered orchids, we kill deer. Humans pick orchids, we dont kill humans.
