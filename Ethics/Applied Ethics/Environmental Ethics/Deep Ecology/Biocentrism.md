its not sentience, rationality, or humanness that morally counts -- its being alive.

How is life defined?
## Biocentrism
See [[Taylor]], [[Leopold]], [[Wienhues]]


### Argument for Ecological Justice
1) being X is alive; 
2) all beings that are alive have a good; 
3) all beings that have a good can flourish. 
	Therefore, X is able to flourish 
4) being Y is an Earthly being. This means the Earth is its only viable basis of existence; 
5) if Y is also X, then it is able to flourish and it needs the Earth’s environmental goods and ecosystem benefits (that is, ecological space) to do so; 
6) there are many beings of the type XY . 
Therefore, all beings of type XY need to share the Earth.

### Respect for Nature
See [[Taylor]]
1.  Rule of Non-Maleficence: “Do no harm to any entity in the natural environment that has a good-of-its-own” ([[Respect for Nature]] 172).
2.  Rule of Non-Interference: “refrain from placing restrictions on the freedom of individual organisms” ([[Respect for Nature]] 173).
3.  Rule of Fidelity: “Do not break trust that an animal places in us” ([[Respect for Nature]] 179).
4.  Rule of Restitutive Justice: “Restore the balance of justice between a moral agent and a moral subject when the subject has been wronged by the agent” ([[Respect for Nature]] 186).
### Argument form EvoPsych
See [[Nolt]]
Pain and pleasure evolved first and foremost to bolster the life function of individual beings. Pain and pleasure cannot be the root of our value axioms as they only exist by and for the real terminal value: life. (Nonanthropocentric Climate Ethics, 704)

## A2 Biocentrism

### What is Life??
lots of different disciplines have differnet definitions of life. Astrobiology, ecology, artificial intelligence studies, etc.  If we arent clear as to what life is, then how can we value it?
	A2: Agar puts it, ‘if an area within the biological sciences can have a concept of life finetuned to suit its needs, then why shouldn’t ethical theory?’ (2001, p. 89).

### Machines also have Telos
Machines have no wellbeing taht is intrinsic to themselves, only instrumental to some other living being
