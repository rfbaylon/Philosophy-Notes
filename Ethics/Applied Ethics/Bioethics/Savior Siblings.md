# Background
In order for allo-HSCT (Stem celll transplant) there needs to be a matching donor, of which parents have a 25% of conceiving. Then, umbilicord blood will need to collected, and then finally the child will have to undergo either peripheral blood harvest or bone marrow harvest.

### American Academy of Pediatrics
The AAP created 5 criteria by which donation from a minor is acceptable
1. There is no compatible adult donor
2. Donor and recipient must be emotionally and personally related
3. A health benefit for the recipient must be likely
4. Clinical and mental risks must be minimized
5. Parents must agree to the procedure

### Designer Babies
"if we allow testing of embryos for life-threatening conditions, then PGD will inevitably be used to test for less severe conditions (King 1999) and ultimately for enhancement or creation of “designer babies” (Adams 2003)"

### Savior Siblings Require Abortion
See [[Abortion]] for the arguments against abortion
	A2: Even if it is the case that savior siblings require abortion most of the time, it is still weighing one fetus vs a full human being. From here it is clear that even if it requires an abortion, it is still ethical (Strong et al., 2011)

### Savior Siblings Break Values of Autonomy
Since informed consent cannot be given due to a childs age as they donate, it would be immoral to force them to 

### Kantian Arguments of Autonomy
A person must not be treated merely or solely as a means to an end. Because these children are used soley for their marrow and their stem cells, and a child second, savior siblings are unethical.
	A2: Conception relies on a misunderstanding of the [[Deontology]]'s second formulation. Under it, people can be used as a means so long as they are also treated as an end in their own right. Because savior siblings can be equally loved and equally treated as human, there is no issue. (Strong et al., 2011)
	A2: Parents who conceive in order to save a childs life are surely more moral than parents who conceive for self interested reasons. Why an issue with the former and not the latter? (Strong et al., 2011)

### Donor Harm
Procedres will harm the donor as the required methods are incredibly invasive.
	A2: There is no emperical evidence to support this claim (Strong et al., 2011) (This is really sus)

### Savior Siblings are not equally loved
#WIP 
	A2: There is no empirical support to this claim.
	A2: There are parents who have children as mistakes who love them just as much as planned children. There is no evidence to say the rates are distinct at all. 

### Analog to Kidney Donation
13 people die every day due to a lack of kidney donor. These are people who's lives could be saved if a donor would undergo anesthesia, undergo the surgery, and losing a kidney as their sole cost. This procedure is *less* intrusive than a bone marrow transplant.
Given this, and given that the savior siblings have no relation to their sibling (yet), it seems like these two situations are analogous, and thus if we allow savior siblings to be ethically permitted, we also ought to hold that taking people's kidneys against their will is also ethical.
