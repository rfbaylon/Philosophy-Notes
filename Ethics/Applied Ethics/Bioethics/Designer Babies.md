## Traits
#### Therapy Trait
Defined by 
Selecting against genetic disabilities
#### Neutral Trait
Defined by 
Sex
Eye color
#### Enhancement Trait
Appearance, fitting more within a beauty standard
Athletics: strength, muscle mass, speed
Intelligence: memory, IQ
### Do these traits exist?
It seems hard to draw boundaries between these. Sex could be considered a therapy trait given social conditions. IQ could be an enhancement or therapy trait depending on social conditions. What even is a disability, how are you so sure that disability is always bad for someone?
# Designer Children OK

### Historic Argument
We already decide what children will be like. We already do IVF, PGD screening, we already choose sperm donors, and most importantly, we choose who we have children with. 

### Principle of Procreative Beneficence
See Savulescu
Therapies make children better off! Higher welfare!
Beyond disease traits, traits like intelligence on average increase welfare for individuals. 
	A2: Inequality. The PoPB will both entrench existing race/sex based inequality *and* further increase socioeconomic inequality. 
		A2A2: Unequal sexual selection wont happen because if there are a lot of men with very few women, then the sexual frustration of the men will be "intolerable" and because of this it would be better to be a woman.
			A2A2A2: Bro, what?
	A2: Mozart objection. By selecting against an embryo, we could be selecting against Mozart without knowing it. 
		A2A2: We have equal reason to believe that embryo A and B will grow up to be Mozart. In other words, by *not* doing it, we would be equally likely to select against Mozart!
	A2: Harm to child.
		A2A2: This cant be true due to the [[Nonidentity Problem]]
	A2: Expressivist. By selecting against people with disabilities, you are sending a message to living people with disabilities saying that "there shouldnt be anyone like you"
		A2A2: There is a difference between bringing people into the world with a disability and treating them like shit once they are alive. Once they are in the world, whether or not they have a disability, they deserve the same protections as people without them. 
#### Wheel of Fortune
Imagine a wheel with equal probabilities for each of the options. The wheel is spin once and that amount of money is put into box A. The wheel is spin again and put in box B. After both spins (the results of which you are blind to), you are allowed to pick a box. If you choose box A, you get the full value in A. If you choose box B, you roll a die. If that die lands on 6, you multiply the value in box B by 80% and get that. If the die lands on 1-5, you get the full value of box B. Would the rational person not choose box A?
	A2: Expected value calculations work for monetary, quantifiable numbers. For something like wellbeing, expected value calculations may just not exist.
	A2: With wheel of fortune, the same person is being benefitted. And the chooser is being benefited. With choosing kids, we are choosing without their knowledge and consent, *and* we are benefitting different people while harming others (see the [[Nonidentity Problem]]).

### Principle of Procreative Autonomy
### Nondirective Counselling
### Parent Welfare
Children with disabilities make the lives of parents harder and much more expensive. 
### Technoinevitability

# Designer Children Bad

### Socioeconomic Inequality
Some parents will choose to select, others wont. The natural kids will face discrimination and harm.

### Intrinsic Inequality
Allowing people to select based on race or sex will allow people to exercises biases (even unbeknownst to them!). People will select 
### Unnatrural
See [[Wilderness]]
### Monoculture
Monoculture is bad for population stability and broader health. 
Also, alternatively, diversity may be valuable for a society.
### Playing God

### NonNeutrality
See McDougall
Allowing neutral traits to be selected is a sign of bad parenting. You should be OK whether your child is a boy or girl. If you do care about these things, you are doing parenting wrong. 

### Hyper Responsibility
See Sandel
People are now responsible for *every* part of a childs gene -- whether or not they gene edit. 

### Unethical Experiment
See Kass
As a technology, we are still very far from understading the risks and harms of this technology. 
1. Cloning children constitutes an unnecessary risk for harm for children
2. If 1, then cloining children is wrong
3. So, cloning children is wrong
### Threatens Identity and Individuality
See Kass
1. Cloned children would econstantly be scruttenized in relation ot their older version
2. If 1, then clonig would create harms of identity and individuality
3. If 2, cloning is morally impermissible
4. So cloning children is wrong
### Procreation Becomes Manufacture
See Kass
1. If something is a commercialized and manmade product, then it is manufactured. 
2. Cloning is commercialized and man made
### Parental Despotism
See Kass
1. Cloning will enable parental despotism over children.
	Children, especially by successful families, will have insane expectations. Baby clone Tom Brady will pretty much be forced to do football, whether or not he likes it.
2. If 1, cloning is wrong
3. So, cloning is wrong
### Wisdom of Repugnance
See Kass
Some practices are so repugnant, there is a wisdom in this repugnance such that we ought to do. Would anyone being unable to provide a rational justificatoin for the wrongness of something be enough grounds to reject it?
	A2: Is cloning really repugnant? What if 
	A2: Is repugnance really wisdom?
