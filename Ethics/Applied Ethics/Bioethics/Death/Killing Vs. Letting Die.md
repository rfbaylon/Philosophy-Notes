## Drawing the Line Argument
#MyArgument At what point is something killing and at what point is something letting die? If I trap someone in a room with no food, *I* didn't technically kill them, but some of my actions did lead to their death along the way. Is this in any way different if someone else trapped them in this room and I just never bothered to let them out? In short, what is the definition of each term if there is a distinction? 


# Killing =/= Letting Die
