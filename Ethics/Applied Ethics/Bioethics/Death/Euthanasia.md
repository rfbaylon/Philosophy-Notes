# Pro Euthanasia

## Voluntary Euthanasia
Euthanasia in which the patient explicitly agrees to their death

### [[Singer]]'s Preference Utilitarian Argument
"Just as a preference Utilitarian must count a desire to continue living as a reason against killing, so it must count as a reason for killing" [[Practical Ethics]], 170

### [[Singer]]'s Argument from Rights Based Morals
Someone may have a right to privacy, but they may also voluntarily waive that right by installing 24/7 webcams in their home
"It is an essential feature of a right that one can waive ones rights if one so chooses."
	A2: This is incredibly controversial in the rights community. For example, [[Kant]] claims that even if someone desires to strip away their autonomy, they still ought not as it is exactly autonomy that gives moral value in the first place. More clearly, you cant give up your right to be a free human.

## Nonvoluntary Euthanasia
Euthanasia in which the patient cannot consent to their death

## Involuntary Euthanasia
Euthanasia in which the patient has explicitly disagrees to their death


# Anti Euthanasia

## Voluntary Euthanasia
Euthanasia in which the patient explicitly agrees to their death
See [[Kant]]

### Argument from Misdiagnoses
There are decent odds that someone who will be killed will die due to bad information. 2 doctors could misdiagnose an issue leading the patient to believe that they will immensley suffer when in reality the person may not. 
	A2: [[Singer]]: When someone accepts voluntary euthanasia, we can also easily extend their responsibility to also accepting the small chance they will be misdiagnosed.

### Argument from Coercion
It will be impossible to know whether or not someone actually wants to die, there could be large amounts of influence from outside parties.
	A2: [[Singer]]: There are many protective measures against this. The Netherlands only allows Euthanasia iff
		- It is carried out b a physician
		- the patient explicitly requested euthanasia that leaves no doubt the request is voluntary
		- The patient experiences unbearable pain
		- There is no reasonable alternative
		- The doctor has consulted another independent professional for a second judgement
			[[Practical Ethics]], 172

### Argument from Paternalism
We don't just give people heroin, so why do we give people pills to kill themself?
	A2: [[J.S. Mill]]: The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of civilized society, against his will, is to prevent harm to others... He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because in the opinions of others, to do so would be wise or even right" [[J.S. Mill; A Selection of His Works]] #Cite 
		I.e., we should be ok to give people heroin
	

### Slippery Slope Argument
[[Lorber]] If we legalize the ability for the state to kill people, then it will lead to genocide or Nazism.
	A2: The death penalty has been legal for centuries, yet no genocide has come from it.
	A2: [[Singer]]: The nazis practiced medical killing for political reasons. Physicians today practice it *for the sake* of the patient. [[Practical Ethics]], 188
