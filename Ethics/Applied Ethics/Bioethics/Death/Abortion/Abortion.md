## When do fetuses feel pain?

The evidence shows that the neural circuitry necessary to distinguish touch from painful touch does not, in fact, develop until late in the third trimester. The occurrence of intrauterine fetal movement is not an indication that a fetus can feel pain.
  
JAMA: The authors defined pain as the awareness of noxious stimuli

DIGRESSION : Using this definition, [[Do plants feel pain]]?
  
Gate theory of pain says pain still happens

“Yet, in the neonate and fetus they seem to perform that additional function,” Dr. Anand said. “The structures and mechanisms used for pain processing in early life are unique to each stage of development. One cannot say that because the structures used for pain perception in adults are underdeveloped in the fetus, pain perception is not present.”In addition, the perception of pain requires more than the participation of the somatosensory cortex in the brain, Dr. Anand contends….The authors of the JAMA article, he said, ignore the fact that pain processing also occurs at the thalamic level. He noted that in their survey of the literature, the authors did not include articles that make such a claim.

Pain is different from [nociception](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/nociception) because pain is primarily a subjective experience of discomfort, despair and other negative affective states (e.g. see [Allen, Fuchs, Shriver, & Wilson, 2005](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347216300513#bib6)). In humans it is possible to have nociception without pain, and pain without any activity in nociceptive fibres ([Hardcastle, 1997](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347216300513#bib24)). For example, after ingesting morphine people can still sense pain, but do so without a sense of suffering or producing characteristic pain behaviours (e.g. wincing) ([Hardcastle, 1997](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347216300513#bib24)).

# Pro Abortion

### Pragmatic Argument
"Does making abortion illegal actually *reduce abortion????*"
#WIP: Need source
	A2: Are ther not confounding factors? could it just not be that legal abrotions are correlated with less necessity for abortion (ie, easier access to contraception)
	A2: This is the legal argument, not the moral argument. Even if it is legal, that doesnt mean it is morally OK

### Libertarian Argument
"The government cant control what I do with my body"
[[J.S. Mill]]
	The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of civilized society, against his will, is to prevent harm to others... He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because in the opinions of others, to do so would be wise or even right" [[J.S. Mill; A Selection of His Works]] #Cite 
		A2: This begs the question. The entire pretext to the abortion debate is to ask if abortion is in fact a victimless crime.

### The Violinist Argument
See [[Thomson]] 
	"You wake up in the morning and find yourself back to back in bed with an unconscious violinist. A famous unconscious violinist. He has been found to have a fatal kidney ailment, and the Society of Music Lovers has canvassed all the available medical records and found that you alone have the right blood type to help. They have therefore kidnapped you, and last night the violinist's circulatory system was plugged into yours, so that your kidneys can be used to extract poisons from his blood as well as your own. The director of the hospital now tells you, "Look, we're sorry the Society of Music Lovers did this to you--we would never have permitted it if we had known. But still, they did it, and the violinist is now plugged into you. To unplug you would be to kill him. But never mind, it's only for nine months. By then he will have recovered from his ailment, and can safely be unplugged from you." Is it morally incumbent on you to accede to this situation? No doubt it would be very nice of you if you did, a great kindness. But do you have to accede to it? What if it were not nine months, but nine years? Or longer still? What if the director of the hospital says. "Tough luck. I agree. but now you've got to stay in bed, with the violinist plugged into you, for the rest of your life. Because remember this. All persons have a right to life, and violinists are persons. Granted you have a right to decide what happens in and to your body, but a person's right to life outweighs your right to decide what happens in and to your body. So you cannot ever be unplugged from him." I imagine you would regard this as outrageous, which suggests that something really is wrong with that plausible-sounding argument I mentioned a moment ago."
From this, the analogy is obvious. You are the mother, the violinist is the child, and the bed is your womb. 
	A2: This is an excellent analogy, but *only* for cases of rape. Because two consenting adults understand there is some sort of chance they will be pregnant by engaging in sex, the onus is on them.
		[[Destiny]] brings up a compelling counter analogy. #Cite 
			(paraphrasing) Imagine there is an exciting new class you want to take at college, but it says on the course sign up sheet that one student will be chosen at random to be hooked to the professor to heal his kidneys by a tube or else he would die. If you sign up for this class understanding the conditions and odds you may be that student, then it would clearly be immoral to drop the class as soon as you were alerted that you were the student chosen at random. Because you signed up for the class understanding the possibility of what could happen, to let the professor die because of something you *consensually* signed up for would of course be immoral.

1. It is wrong to kill an innocent human being
2. A fetus is an innocent human being
3. Therefore, it is wrong to kill a fetus
