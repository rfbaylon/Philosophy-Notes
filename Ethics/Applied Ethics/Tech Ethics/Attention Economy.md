## Addiction and Biohacking
Phones in general are well designed to keep people using them, and they are as such on purpose. The main two drives keeping people on phones are two well known cognitive biases: FOMO and tendencies towards intermittent positive reinforcement.

## Direct Harms

### Anxiety
According to [Goodwin et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7441973/), anxiety rates in young adults (18-25) have doubled (7%-14%), and for the general public have increased by 20% (5%-6%) from 2008-2018

### Conversation
See Turkle
Sherry Turkle makes the argument that good conversation has been lost to text based communication. Because its much more convenient, a lot of the nuance and art of face to face conversations is pushed to the wayside in favor of text based communication. This has the effect of atomizing communities and relationships.

### Loneliness
According to [Deters & Mehl 2012](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550612469233), more posts on social media decrease self reported feelings of loneliness ([[Digital Minimalism (Book)]], loc 1648). Another study, [Primack 2012](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/314258481_Social_Media_Use_and_Perceived_Social_Isolation_Among_Young_Adults_in_the_US), ([[Digital Minimalism (Book)]], loc 1658) finds that more times spent on social media increases loneliness measured by a psychiatric test. These seemingly contradictory points might actually build a more complete picture. Social media does temporarily alleviate loneliness, but overall encourages it. 
### Time
[A Common Sense Media study](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/press-releases/landmark-report-us-teens-use-an-average-of-nine-hours-of-media-per-day-tweens-use-six-hours) from 2015 (the first of its kind) found that teenagers (13-18) use an average of nine hours of entertainment media per day.
	On average among teens 39% of digital screen time (computers, tablets, and smartphones) is devoted to passive consumption (watching, listening, or reading), 25% to interactive content (playing games, browsing the web), 26% to communication (social media, video-chatting), and 3% to content creation (writing, coding, or making digital art or music).

Similar findings were found for parents in [a later study](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/press-releases/new-report-parents-spend-more-than-nine-hours-a-day-with-screen-media)by the same authors where parents spend over 7 hours a day on nonwork media.
