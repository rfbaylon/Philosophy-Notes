[[The Shallows]] argues that the internet is a poor medium for deep knowledge produciton. Though it might be good at finding lifehacks or quick facts, it disincentivizes sitting deeply with material.

Thinking has taken on a 'staccato quality' ([[The Shallows]] 18)

## Folk-y Evidence
### [[Nietzsche]]'s Writing Ball
In 1882, Nietzsche ordered a ball shaped typewriter due to his failing vision. Though Nietzsche resumed writing, his writing now had tighter, more telegraphic prose. A friend wrote to Nietzsche noting the change, and he replied "you are right,  our writing equipment  takes part in the forming of our thoughts"

## Neuro-scientific Evidence

### Monkeys
As monkeys were trained to use tools to grab food, scientists monitored the monkeys neural activity. In doing so, they discovered that the rakes and pliers actually became incorporated into the neural mapping of the hands. The tools, according to these monkeys brains, were functionally part of their bodies

This is pretty much exact neurological evidence for [[Heidegger]]'s hammer case.

### London Cabbies
Before GPS, London Cabbies knew all of the streets by memory, but after, there were measured changes in the hippocampus and other brain areas involved in spatial modelling and memory due to a reliance on GPS. The area previously used for mapping shrank while the area used for rapidly deciphering information likely grew.
