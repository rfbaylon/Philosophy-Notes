[[The Shallows]] argues that the internet is a poor medium for deep knowledge produciton. Though it might be good at finding lifehacks or quick facts, it disincentivizes sitting deeply with material.

Thinking has taken on a 'staccato quality' ([[The Shallows]] 18)

"Music albums are split apart, their songs sold through iTunes or streamed through Spotify. Even the songs themselves are broken into pieces, with their riffs and hooks packaged as ringtones for ell phones. Theres much to be said for what economists call the "unbundling" of content. It provides people with more choices and frees them from unwanted purchases. but it also illustrates and reinforces the changing patterns of media consumption promoted by the Web. "When access to information is easy, we tend to favor the short, the sweet, and the bitty.""

Much of other media has also become more weblike. Jimmy Fallon's show caters towards being clipped for YouTube, the WSJ and NYT both have begun shortening their paragraphs and adding more images.

"Now that the context of reading is again shifting, from the private page to the communal screen, authors will adapt once more. They will be increasingly tailor their work to a milieu that the essayist Caleb Crain describes as "groupness" where people read mainly for the sake of a feeling of belonging rather than for  personal enlightenment or amusement"

David Levy in *Scrolling Forward* describes the release of multiple windowed computers. To demonstrate, Xerox, the company releasing it, showed a popup email message and quickly replied to it before returning to coding. Half the audience welcomed it, touting its effeciency. The other recoiled. "Why in the world would you want to be interrupted and distracted by email while programming??"

	The point here isnt to say one is better than the other -- its just to say that the invisible choice has been made to reject the solitary concentration in favor of the juggler. 
## The case
Once information is digitized, we lose specialization. Think mobile phones that replace GPS, cameras, cell phones, MP3 players, TVs, etc. The information on the internet is similar, where there are no boundaries between tools. 

Hyperlinks are nothing like citations. They dont merely inform us that there is related work, it propels us towards the related work and abandon the original. Hyperlinks encourage us dipping into a lot of different texts without sitting with one for a sustained amount of time. "We dont see the forest when we search the web. We dont even see the trees. We see twigs and leaves"

Searches additionally locate clips of works rather than works themselves, incentivizing taking quotes or 'the gist' to be equivalent to the whole work. Less whole work is consumed, a lot more gists are. 

Web pages additionally incorporate distractions, including widgets, email lists, advertisements, gifs, and subscription messages which dont come with other mediums


## Folk-y Evidence
### [[Nietzsche]]'s Writing Ball
In 1882, Nietzsche ordered a ball shaped typewriter due to his failing vision. Though Nietzsche resumed writing, his writing now had tighter, more telegraphic prose. A friend wrote to Nietzsche noting the change, and he replied "you are right,  our writing equipment  takes part in the forming of our thoughts"

## Neuro-scientific Evidence

### Monkeys
As monkeys were trained to use tools to grab food, scientists monitored the monkeys neural activity. In doing so, they discovered that the rakes and pliers actually became incorporated into the neural mapping of the hands. The tools, according to these monkeys brains, were functionally part of their bodies

This is pretty much exact neurological evidence for [[Heidegger]]'s hammer case.

### London Cabbies
Before GPS, London Cabbies knew all of the streets by memory, but after, there were measured changes in the hippocampus and other brain areas involved in spatial modelling and memory due to a reliance on GPS. The area previously used for mapping shrank while the area used for rapidly deciphering information likely grew.
