# Artifacts Themselves Have Politics
Use [[Internet and Knowledge Production]] as a case study for this position

### The medium is the message
See [[The Shallows]], [[McLuhan]]
"Our conventional response to all media, namely that it is how they are used that counts, is the numb stance of the technological idiot. The content of a medium is just the juicy piece of meat carried by the burglar to distract the watchdog of the mind"
	[[McLuhan]] cited in [[The Shallows]], p15

### Tech is designed for settling issues
See Winner

### Certain techs require certain social structures

#### Examples
New York bridge overpasses are intentionally extremely low, meaning busses cannot pass under them. This was reflected in the designers biography as explicit racial and class bias.

Mechanical tomato harvesters became the new norm as they saved money by not requiring farm workers. This change required that tomatoes become more uniform in their ripening and sturdier to withstand the machine, creating less tasty tomatoes. The tomato harvester embodies the social order that benefits the capital owners.

### Social systems arise from Tech
Even with a total and complete overthrow of the bourgeoise, keeping the same technology as is will lead to social inequalities. [[Engels]] believed that keeping the same factories with the same machines still required an authority in order to keep up production, as that is how the machines were designed.
[[Plato]] said something similar but opposite, arguing that ships require a captain and that democracy cannot work with the design of a ship. He then extrapolated from this that this is how a state should be run. The difference between [[Plato]] and [[Engels]] is that Plato uses the ship to justify authority and Engels uses it define authority.
