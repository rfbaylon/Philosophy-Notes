# Artifacts Themselves Have Politics
Use [[Internet and Knowledge Production]] as a case study for this position

There are 4 ways technology impacts human behavior
1. augmenting physical strength (plow, darning needle, fighter jet)
2. augmenting sensitivity (microscope, speakers)
3. reshaping nature (birth control pill, dams, gmos)
4. augmenting intellectual strength (book, typewriter, globe) (see [[Internet and Knowledge Production]])

#### Misc. Quotes
"The windmill gives you society with the feudal lord; the steam-mill, society with the industrial capitalist" - [[Marx]]

"Things are in the saddle/And ride mankind" - [[Emerson]]

"Even as our technologies become extensions of ourselves, we become extensions of our technologies. When the carpenter takes his hammer into his hand, he can use that hand only to do what a hammer can do. The hand becomes an implement for pounding and pulling nails. When the soldier putes the binoculars to his eyes, he can see only what the lenses allow him to see. His field of view lengthens, but he becomes blind to whats nearby. [[Nietzsche]]'s experience with his typewriter provides a particularly good illustration of the way technologies exert their influence on us. Not only did the philosopher come to imagine that his writing ball was "a thing like me" he also sensed that he was becoming a thing like it, that his typewriter was shaping his thoughts."
	[[The Shallows]], 183

"Our tools end up 'numbing' whatever part of our body they 'amplify.' - [[McLuhan]]

"The tide of technological revolution (could) "so captivate, bewitch, dazzle, and beguile man that calculative thinking may someday come to be accepted and practiced as the *only way of thinking*... The frenziedness of technology threatens to entrench itself everywhere" - [[Heidegger]]
	[[The Shallows]] 193

### The medium is the message
See [[The Shallows]], [[McLuhan]]
"Our conventional response to all media, namely that it is how they are used that counts, is the numb stance of the technological idiot. The content of a medium is just the juicy piece of meat carried by the burglar to distract the watchdog of the mind"
	[[McLuhan]] cited in [[The Shallows]], p15

### Tech is designed for settling issues
See Winner

### Certain techs require certain social structures
Nuclear weapons could only exist given a authoritarian social structure where clearly not everyone would be able to use it. As a technology, it requires a hierarchal chain of command and political secrecy

A centralized nuclear energy plant could not arise from a pure democracy, rather solar energies are decentralized and bolster democracy.

### Social systems arise from Tech
Even with a total and complete overthrow of the bourgeoise, keeping the same technology as is will lead to social inequalities. [[Engels]] believed that keeping the same factories with the same machines still required an authority in order to keep up production, as that is how the machines were designed.
[[Plato]] said something similar but opposite, arguing that ships require a captain and that democracy cannot work with the design of a ship. He then extrapolated from this that this is how a state should be run. The difference between [[Plato]] and [[Engels]] is that Plato uses the ship to justify authority and Engels uses it define authority.

## Examples
New York bridge overpasses are intentionally extremely low, meaning busses cannot pass under them. This was reflected in the designers biography as explicit racial and class bias.

Expensive iron molding machines were developed in order to break unions, not for efficiency. They were more expensive and less efficient, but required unskilled labor meaning that the bourgeoise could break up unions.
	Do Artifacts Have Politics, 125

Handicapped people only recently (1970s) began to point out and demand a remedy for their systemic exclusion from infrastructure technologies.

Mechanical tomato harvesters became the new norm as they saved money by not requiring farm workers. This change required that tomatoes become more uniform in their ripening and sturdier to withstand the machine, creating less tasty tomatoes. The tomato harvester embodies the social order that benefits the capital owners.

### Clocks
The desire for accurate time keeping came from Christian monks in the Middle Ages, who maintained a rigorous schedule of prayer. As clocks spread, bells came to not just signify, but define meal times, market closures, assemblies, and cleanings. As each town became standardized, they then looked to standardize among other towns. 

The miniturization of clocks (watches) made life more private, as well as acted as a constant monitor of time spent, time lost stimulating the early industrial culture.

"In deciding when to eat to work, to sleep, to wake up, we stopped listening to our senses and started obeying the clock. We became a lot more scientific, but we became a lot more mechanical as well."
	[[The Shallows]] 285

### Computers

"The computer was not a prerequisite to the survivla of modern society in the post-war period and beyond. Its entusiastic, uncritical em;brace by the most progressive elements of American government, business, and industry made it a resource essential to society's survival *in the form* that the computer itself had been instrumental in shaping"
