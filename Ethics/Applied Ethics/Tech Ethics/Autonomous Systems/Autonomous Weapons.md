AKA: LARs or AWS

# Development is Good

### Fewer mistaken killings
There will not only be less pilots killed in battle, but, hopefully, AWS would be better at deciding who is or is not a combatant or civilian

### National Security

### Less PTSD
### Mutually Assured Destruction

# Development is Bad

### Lower Barrier to War
If entering war becomes cheaper and if less human soldiers are sent, there would be less public backlash to war.

### Vulnerability & Terrorism
It seems possible that AWSs could be repurposed by terrorists to fight against civilians. This would also make it so violence might be easier to do since the weapon would be more anonymous.

### Arms Race
As soon as one country gets AWS, all countries need AWS

### Dignity
Its a violation of dignity to kill someone while refusing to face them. 

### Responsibility Gap
See Purves
When AWSs are deployed, nobody can be held responsible when it makes a mistake.
1. it is a necessary condition of using AWS that there is someone who can be held responsible for its actions
2. If 1, then there is a pro tanto reason to not deploy AWS (I.e., there is no party that can be held responsible for the AWS)
	AWS? No, not a moral agent, it doesnt know what it did
	Commanders? No, they dont have any meaningful control over the killing
	Engineers? No, they dont have any meaningful control over who gets killed or how.
	Politicians? No, they are just representing the will of the people. They also dont have meaningful control over how the machine acts in the field.
	Citizens? No, each individual has incredibly little power. Plus, lots of citizens are against it.
1. So, there is a pro tanto reason to not deploy AWS

### Right Reasons Objections
To justifiably kill someone, one needs to act from right reasons. AWSs cannot act from reasons at all. Therefore, AWSs cannot justifiably kill someone

### Anti-Codifiability Argument
