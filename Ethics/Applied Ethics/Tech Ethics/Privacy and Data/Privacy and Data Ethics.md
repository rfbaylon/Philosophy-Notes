# Why is privacy important?

Its not just your attention thats the goal of targeted ads. Instead, its the subtle, unrecognizable changes in behavior of the consumer. 

The Streisand Effect: If you sue for provacy invasions, your privacy will be further invaded because of it.
# Legal Background
See [[Citron]]

Section 230 of the Communication Decency Act is a clause that allows social media companies to legally not be publishers of the content on their site. If they were responsible in this way, they would be fully liable for everything said on their site, essentially as an editor. This section also allows companies to not be liable for illegal things said on social media sites.

 With this in mind, there are only 4 privacy invasions seen as illegal
 - Publication of hyperpersonal private facts
 - Unconsensual use of likeness in advertising
 - Interference of enjoyment of private spaces
 - Slander

## Legal Cases

Herrick had an ex that would impersonate him on grindr, tell strangers to come to his house for rape-play. Despite many attempts to remove his ex's profile of him off the site, Herrick v Grindr was upheld in Grindr's favor as section 230 meant they were not responsible for removing the ex from the site.

	Germany has a provision to force social media companies to remove illegal content within 24 hours of a report, and the EU follows suit with a similar law.

## Legal Steps Forward

Currently, 5 states have legislated the UDII, which allows for injunctive relief for victims of  intimate privacy invasions.
	[[The Fight for Privacy]], 136

## Legal Proposals

1. No data about intimate things (gender, sex, health, sexuality, etc) can be sold unless these are vital to the service
2. Explicit, *informed* consent is required to collect data. This means no more "take it or leave it" TOS's. Customers should have the option to either pay for the service in data or money.
3. Data cannot be used to discriminate along protected classes
4. Data cannot be sold unless it is from the first party themself. You cannot sell other people's data.

# Current Industry Practices

## Goals
Right now, the tech industry has 3 goals
	1. User engagement (measured in time)
	2. Growth of the platform (measured in active users)
	3.  Happier advertisers (measured in cost/ad)
None of these goals correlate with human wellbeing.

## Practice

### Smart-home Devices
Smart-home devices have a very low threshold for recording audio. A Northeastern Study (Allen St. John, 2019) found 63 false positives in 21 hours of listening to episodes of the Gilmore Girls

According to whistleblowers, Siri has recorded people having sex without their knowledge.

## Is privacy a right?

UDHR recognizes privacy as a human right.

#### Is privacy a *civil* right?
See Allen, [[Citron]]
As a note, this debate is super new. Maybe starting around 2015.

What it means to say this is that privacy is a core requirement of citizenship and flourishing meriting the protection of law like equal access to the polls, places of accommodation, public education, housing, and jobs.
##### Yes
See [[Citron]]

The traditonal argumetn is that algorithms use racialized data to discriminate against minorities on the internet

First, it is a civil liberty (freedom from government surveillance) and second it is a civil right (protections from discrimination)
	[[The Fight for Privacy]], 105

Privacy is vital for meaningful relationships, meaningful relationships are vital for human flourishing. Hence, they ought to be a civil right. 
	[[The Fight for Privacy]], 117

##### No
If you are to make privacy a civil right, there needs to be a really strong connection with civil right era policies

There are actually a lot of ways in which privacy *hurts* social justice
	Hannah [[Arendt]] argued that schools ought not be desegregated because white students have a right to privacy. She clearly saw privacy as a weapon against civil rights.
	FERPA has acted as a hurdle to allowing whistleblowers to show discrimination happening in black schools. Because schools cannot hand over transcripts to outlets, there cannot be any evidence of disparaged outcomes for minority students.
	There are also older cases which emphasized the sovereignty of the master-slave relationship or the abuser-abused relationship -- the argument was that we should not override the privacy of the plantation or the home. 
		 But be sure not to throw the baby out with the bathwater though!

Privacy is essential to secure civil rights =/= privacy *is* a civil right. 

If privacy as a civil right is to be treated as a civil right, then the policies that are created in support of it are incredibly weak showing policy authors to not fully consider civil rights highly
	IE, if you can waive your right to privacy, and it is a civil right, then why not allow people to waive their right to segregate public spaces or to be redlined? Yikes.
