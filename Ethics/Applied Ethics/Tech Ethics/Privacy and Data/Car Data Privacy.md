**Thesis: There are a lot of worries about car data collection, but the very specific situation mentioned in the case is likely OK** 

SmartDriver motivations (its good to drive safer\! But at what cost:)

**Privacy**

- Tesla lawsuit to open  
- Tesla collects minutes of vid data  
- Breadcrumbs of all location  
- Hands on wheel, seatbelt, brake data, speed data, acc data, etc.  
- 76% of top car companies collect data

**Transparency**

- Palm Beach case to open  
- Signup Process  
- Worth 100b now, 800b by 2030  
- No data ownership (1.4k)

**Policing**

- 2021 Ring case  
- No warrant for a search\!

**Back to the Case**

- Safety  
- Privacy  
  - If data isnt sent to car manufacturer or insurance, no biggie  
  - Then only data is that there is a call  
- Transparency/knowledge  
  - Feature can be toggled  
  - If he can't shut it off, fair to assume autonomy is least of his worries  
- Policing  
  - Calls 911, not police

**A2: But safer roads\!**

## 

## Simple structure 

We are more connected than ever with the things in our lives: cars, toasters, fridges, and doorbells. What does this mean for how we should live our lives?

**1). Roadmap and Values** 

Potential Goods:

- Safety

Potential Harms:

- Privacy  
- Autonomy

Applied to 911

**2). Privacy**

- Problems:

Tesla collects an absurd amount of data about their customers

- Tesla had enough data on *one customer* to prove they were non-negligent for their death (showed driving routes \+ avg speed)  
- Tesla also collects minutes of camera data at a time of surroundings using the car cameras, which they state are able to be shared with law enforcement and other third party “business partners”  
- They collect “Gateway log” files—periodically uploaded to Tesla—including seatbelt, Autopilot, and cruise-control settings, and whether drivers had their hands on the steering wheel  
- If you want a copy of your own data you have to pay $1400 for a kit, and if you want to get rid of the collection feature have to take to a mechanic to remove the hardware, which also gets rid of internet access features, remote services, voice commands, and OTA updates (hardware updates)  
- The data is valued at 53 billion. By 2030, the market is said to be worth 800 billion.    
- Most other cars go through third parties (LexisNexis, Verisk, Telematic) who in total have tens of millions of cars

Acceptable losses of privacy

- EZ Pass

**3). Knowledge**

- Problems:  
  - Selling data to car insurance without telling clients  
    - Most modern cars have opt in systems (Smart Driver) that tell you “slow down” “stop slower” but car salesmen that enroll people do not tell them that GM or LexusNexus *also* collect the data without their information  
    - GM only makes in the low millions from this data and sells it to insurance companies  
    - Case of a man in palm beach florida whos insurance canceled him of nowhere, he asked why, his insurance sent him an entire spreadsheet with average speed, acceleration, brake speed, etc. He was denied by 7 other insurance companies, and ended up with one at triple the price  
    - 76% of top car companies sell your personal data  

,  
**4\) Police**

We are scared of the police getting involved\!

- In 2021 Ring handed over data to the local police without the knowledge of the person using it  
- Tesla also gives driving data (location, address, etc.) to the police and other third parties working with Tesla  
- Bypasses the need for a warrant for reasonable search. 

**4\) Back to the case:**

- Privacy  
  - The valid concern: that your data could be sent to people with malicious intent, and now there are individuals who know where you’re driving  
  - The only data sent is a phone call  
- Safety  
  - This is the difference between life or death\!  
- Autonomy  
  - The valid concern: your personal property can violate your autonomy in a way you didn’t expect/weren’t aware of  
  - Feature itself can be toggled  
  - He could shut off call as a false alarm  
  - If one can't shut it off, fair to assume something far worse has happened.

- The autonomy in this case; maybe he wasn’t made aware enough of it   
- It’s like signing the term and conditions 

Structure? Automatic response system

- Framework: Criteria for technology performing autonomous decision-making  
  - Autonomous decision making  
  - Values: Safety, privacy, autonomy  
  - Establish what sort of technology this is (differentiate automated protocol from automated *decisions*)  
  - Distinctions between automated design making and privacy/autonomy  
- Apply to this case  
  - Place it in the pile of automatic design-making/protocol following (?), but there are some inputs  
  - What is this technology:  
    - Automated emergency call system  
      - Establishes a call with the driver, if passengers don’t respond or sound like they’re in distress, then EMS is called  
      - The only info sent is the location of the vehicle, and how many passengers  
      - It can be turned off prior to anything occurring  
  - For the privacy bit, not an automatic warrant.   
  - Non-sentient witness? A ring camera   
  - Cars are already non-sentient witness  
    - “Non sentient witness” is just evidence  
- Apply to the case in general   
  - Analogous Cases  
    - Car reports itself for speeding and automatically sends people tickets  
      - Similar: Safety, Surveillance  
      - Ford is literally creating this technology right now\!   
    - EZ Pass  
      - Similar: Surveillance  
    - Maybe Über or Ring   
- Counter-arguments (could be in our application of our framework, or of the framework)

Your own property surveils you

**Another version of the case**

- What are our values (extract from case)  
  - Safety, Privacy/Surveillance (property), Freedom of Choice (consent)/autonomy,   
- How do they play out in the analogous cases  
- Speed tracking (more hypothetical, in dev from Ford)  
- EZ pass (Paige)  
  - System made to make paying tolls easier  
  - A transponder in your car sends your account information to a central database & money is removed from your account when you go through the toll. Your license plate number is always surveilled in the EZ Pass lane  
  - If you go through the lane without a transponder, or your transponder is not properly placed on your car, or with a car whose license plate is not registered with your account, you will receive a fine (toll plus an administrative fee).   
  - Similar to the case: **A monitoring system that can automatically punish you** (send a fine). In this case there are NO safety concerns, as the system exists to ensure tolls are paid, not that safe driving is occurring.   
    - Is this system seen as a violation of privacy?  
      - Not really because it is opt in (you choose to drive through the EZ Pass lane). It is also widely held that the benefits outweigh any privacy concerns from the fact that a car’s owner can be identified by authorities through its license plate.  
    - CONCLUSION: From this example, we can see that monitoring systems that automatically punish people are not prima facie unacceptable.   
- Ring (Hue)  
  - **Overview**: A doorbell system (run by Amazon), which starts a live audio/video connection (and the resulting recording is then stored on your account and in Ring’s database) of anyone who rings your doorbell, even establishing a voice connection so you can see who is coming up to your door without having to physically be there  
  - **Privacy/surveillance concern:**  
    - Yes\! Video will be recorded and stored by the company. This includes all regular data you provide to them (name, address, etc.), but also detailed records of all your doorbell activity including the video and audio footage.   
    - This doesn’t just apply to the owner, the camera and microphone is set off by motion upto 25ft away and with a 180 degree range of motion. This means Ring would have not only video and audio footage of you and your family, but also whoever is walking by across the street, etc.: people who didn’t consent to being recorded and surveilled by this device.  
    - According to their privacy policy: “ Deleted Content and Ring Protect Recordings may be stored by Ring in order to comply with certain legal obligations and are not retrievable without a valid court order”  
    - As of 2021, they’ve given Ring footage to over 2000 law enforcement agencies.  
      - While in theory we would want law enforcement to respond and prevent crime as quickly as they can, by introducing products that are capable of surveillance in our daily lives, police are given an exponentially greater surveillance capabilities (especially via Ring’s user discussion board where users can send footage of “suspisious activity in their neighborhoods”)  
      - Increase in lateral surveillance \-\> private individuals recording and reporting information about other private individuals; essentially neighbors spying on neighbors  
      - Exacerbates existing problems in over-policing and bias against black and brown communities  
    - In an audit conducted by NYU’s Policing Project, Ring has taken steps in editing their TOS and limiting its collaboration with law enforcement agencies  
      - However, the feature that enables their data to solely be stored locally is an opt-OUT feature that isn’t readily disclosed to the user upon purchase, displaying still a lack of user transparency  
  - **Steps forward** (as outlined by the Policing Project):  
    - Substantive  
      - Use limitations \- no use in non-legitimate (discriminatory) law enforcement purposes to mitigate risk in over-policing  
    - Procedural   
      - Warrant requirements  
      - Use policies readily available to the public  
        - Who can/can’t use it  
        - What data is stored  
        - Internal oversight/accountability mechanisms  
        - Privacy protections  
        - Means of enforcement   
  - ***Bringing it back to the case:** the main similarity being that your devices can take your personal data, and potentially be used against you depending on who stores it. The safety concern in this case does not outweigh the numerous privacy considerations with such technology*  
    - *HOWEVER, the main difference between the emergency call system and the Ring camera is that there IS an obvious “opt-out feature” in the driver/passengers’ ability to respond to the call and tell 911 EMS isn’t necessary.*   
    - *The privacy concern is negligible, as the only data given is what would be relevant to EMS in a car crash, etc. scenario such as how many passengers and location (only at the time of the call). No data is kept beyond a record of the call, and no data is able to be taken of unsuspecting bystanders*  
    - *In the case of Ring the safety and security measures, law enforcement intend to use footage as evidence in a criminal proceeding, however the safety concern with ECS is the immediate physical safety of the car’s passengers*  
  - *Conclusion: the privacy concerns presented by ECS are outweighed by the immediate safety concerns, and therefore acceptable*

    

- Virtual assistants: Alexa (Ricardo)

  - What is Alexa?  
    - Highly autonomous systems: Carry out actions on our behalf, learn and change over time, and adapt/respond to local conditions via external sensor information or updated input data.   
      - Always-on, always-near virtual assistants such as the Amazon Alexa are designed to reside in our homes permanently or remain on-the-body. These virtual assistants are designed to learn our behaviors and preferences over time, gather contextual information from the environment (e.g. location), and learn from our constantly updated user profiles  
      - Our relationships to these types of technologies are different from our relationships with technologies that function simply as tools, since they take on the roles of assistants or collaborators. They will likely spend more time with us because of their independence and this will lead to a longer term relationship with this technology.  
- **Privacy, transparency/user autonomy**: Amazon Alexa devices collect vast amounts of sensitive user data, including voice recordings and geolocation information. It uses this data in order to improve its performance, control other smart devices, and personalize their marketing towards users.   
1. False triggers of Alexa still send voice information to servers.  
   - In experiments, Alexa-enabled devices are frequently triggered during normal conversations. The default Alexa wake-up keyword “Alexa” is frequently triggered by many other unrelated words– more so than the other voice assistants. This is a potential privacy exposure since Amazon devices typically recognize false activations after sending the whole sentence to their servers (with the sentence being permanently stored).   
     - **Privacy** concerns about information exposed by IoT (internet of things) devices is warranted.  
2. Extensive data collection poses significant privacy risks, especially when it comes to children's data. The FTC charged Amazon with violating children's privacy laws by retaining voice recordings and geolocation data from children indefinitely, using this information for its own purposes like algorithm training.  
3. Despite assurances that users could delete their voice recordings and geolocation data, Amazon often retained this information for years. This lack of **transparency** undermines user trust and **autonomy** in managing their personal data.  
- Bringing it back to the case:  
  - The value of safety is not pertinent as a justification for Amazon’s data collection in this case, as Alexa’s data collection is aimed at improving service quality and user experience.  
- Important aspects of addressing these concerns are transparency and the promotion of user autonomy  
  - User autonomy: Control/consent over how data is used or shared.  
    - Shane’s input over whether the call is made.   
  - Transparency: Extent to which data is used and can be deleted by users.  
    - Shane’s understanding of the car’s automated emergency call service.

    

- Uber (Andrew)  
  - The case: Uber collects location data on the people using its app. Currently users have to opt out of uber accessing location at all times (i.e., when the app is not in use). Developers have a tool called God’s view which can be used to track and spy on individual users (including celebrities and ex-boyfriends/girlfriends). Uber employees got caught doing this. Uber then remanded it ‘heaven’s view’ and claims they have restricted access internally.   
  - What is analogous? \- Privacy concerns? What is the automated piece? The sharing of location data   
    - Your private property is constantly monitoring your whereabouts. Similar to if your car recorded your speed constantly. Very different than something like CCTV  
    - Data is unwittingly shared \-\> similar to your car sharing when you get in a car accident with the police  
    - Sharing location data at all times could prevent kidnappings. While Uber has been caught using this technology in bad faith, it’s possible a number of crimes (e.g., kidnapping) could be more easily prevented  
  - The privacy violation is particularly egregious here\! This is especially true because the countervailing safety benefit is non-existent the way uber use the data  
  - Even if some company or the government was using the data in a well-meaning way, there is a huge potential for abuse  
  - When you have a case with similar privacy concerns with the safety benefit removed, the weight of privacy concerns becomes quite clear  
    - Other things a car could do autonomously:  
      - Anti-theft mechanisms (possibly with a camera)  
-   
- Highlight key differences/similarities, how are the values respected, violated; use this to inform decision on main case  
- Maybe each analogy focuses on one value (maybe more)

### Feedback

Mark:  
The big issues, looking for an ethical framework \-  
Case-based reasoning (in english common law). Make appeal to precedent   
Caus-something argument. They are made quickly, to articulate the principle

Justify the use of case-based reasoning (e.g., some global theory is too abstract. We want to look at norms that have played out, and apply them hear)  
Turn down the volume on the cases. 

Ryan:  
Structure. The thing we had is safety, privacy, autonomy,  
Could organize by value, and use cases to draw them out  
Weakness: lack of clarity on privacy violations \- police vs dragnet vs stalking. Need more nuance, distinction

- 

- Highlight ethical framework, explain why you are using causist argumentation  
  - Cases should go by fast: We should highlight the principles and how they apply  
  - Cut cases altogether/cut them in half (less elaboration)  
- Read more about casustic cases
