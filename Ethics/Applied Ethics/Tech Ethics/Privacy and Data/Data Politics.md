#### To-do
Look into Myanmar government advertising to their citizens about the dangers of Rohingya Muslims, increasing the hate crimes and legal pressure against the people.

Look into internal facebook 2016 (?) midterm election, where facebook claims they had influence over the election through advertisers. 

Microtargeting in Politics

How is microtargeting different from macrotargeting?
- Extremely targeted
- Extremely tailored

### The Emperics
On facebook, you can garget as few as 100 people and there are over 50k different advertising categories.

## The Ethics

### Content-based wrongness
#### Fake News
 In 2019, the UK conservative party wrote a fake BBC headline that was then advertised to conservative voters. The BBC denied this as their work.

#### Racism
Angwin & Paris
If you can microtarget to very specific demographics, its much easier to deliver racist content to people who want to see it. 

### Content-neutral wrongness

Microtargeting violates the deocratic norm of publicity.

Democracy requires publicity in deliberation of an adequate standard. Deliberation that is public, accessible,  and otherwise adequate  is crucial for a functioning democracy. Under what other grounds could one reasonably accept a loss in an election?

Silent Democracy
A democracy by which there is no discussion of politics
A democracy of this kind would be siloed in each individual mind that would lead to extreme information balkanization. Voters would not update beliefs and preferences from social interaction.
