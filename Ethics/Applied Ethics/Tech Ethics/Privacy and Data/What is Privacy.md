# What is Privacy?

### Privacy is Contextual Integrity
See [[Nissenbaum]]
[[Nissenbaum]]: Privacy is appropriate information flow that is conformant with *legitimate* and *contextual* informational norms.

[[Nissenbaum]]'s Benchmarks for a good definition:
- Faithful to common use
- clear and rigorous
- Reveals privacy's ethical significance 
- explains the technology challenges
- Informs technology and policy

Contextual Informational Norms have a formula to figure out:
<actors, subject>, <attributes,>, <transmission principle,>
	actors: customers, students, programmers
	attributes: books you have read, age, gender, SSN, amount spent on a house
	transmission principle: with consent, with a warrant, with money, stealing
	To Nisenbaum, contexts are differentiated (eg, health, education, family, etc), interspatial, intertemporal, overlapping, and constitues by functions, practices, and differentiated roles.
		Contextual informational norms: actors, sender, recipient, attributes, transmission-principle
	Appropriate flows: 
	- Healthcare: cure disease, alleviate pain and suffering
	- Politics: democracy, autonomy, accountabiliy
	- School: 
		What [[Nissenbaum]]'s position reveals is that services such as GPSs are not breaches in privacy as those are entirely appropriate flows!

Important to this as well is the rejection of the privates/public distinction (following lots of Gender and Race theory "The personal is political"). Whether or not information is technically public or private has *no bearing* on the appropriateness of the information flow. What actually matters is whether or not the flow is OK. This distinction doesnt actually track anything useful.
