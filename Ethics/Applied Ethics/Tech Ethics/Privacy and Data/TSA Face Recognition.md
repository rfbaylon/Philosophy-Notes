**Background**

- TSA‚Äôs Function  
- How the Tech Works

**Thesis: The TSA has far overstepped its duty of upholding airport security by storing/sharing passenger data beyond necessary function.** (or, our collaborators and judges should opt out when they go home for thanksgiving)

### Values / Why Care

**Security**

- *Why?* Inhibiting trafficking, bombs and dangerous individuals (and water bottles) on planes protects passengers and creates a safer perception of air travel

**Privacy**

- **Though *just* this information isn't the worst, concern is raised when it is a small part of a larger profile passed between government agencies.**  
- *Why?* Power imbalance (\!\!)  
- *Why?* Data used to influence thoughts/behavior  
- *Why?* Political suppression (China)

**Informed Consent**

- *Why?* Our tax dollars pay for it and government is intended for the people  
- Decide off awareness of how data is gathered, why and where it will go, and have clear opt-out alternatives where possible

### Applied to TSA‚Äôs Policy

**Security (+)**

- Consistent, Effective, and Efficient  
- **But no data needs to be *kept* for TSA security benefits \-- all that needs to happen is an encrypted checking between agent and databases without data scraping**

**Privacy (-)**

- Too much data is collected (Useless firewall \[image deleted, but image data kept\])  
- TSA has history of insecure servers (OMB cyber attack)  
- Shared beyond essential function (local police, DHS, CBP)

**Informed Consent (-)**

- TSA Chief wants to get rid of Opt Out  
- Opt out info is unclear or hidden (those it‚Äôs servicing denied intuitive choice)  
  - Unspecific signage that you can opt out, but not what opt in means.

# **THE PILE**

# Potential Harms & Values:

## Security

- Facial recognition technology reduces the risk of human error in recognizing identity fraud/threats (more consistent), can be cross-checked with government databases to detect potential threats early (more effective), and is checked almost instantaneously (more efficient). Therefore, this tech helps ensure safety/that we catch violent criminals  
- People being safe is cool üôÇ   
- Catching violent criminals is also cool\!

## Privacy

- Strengthens **power imbalance** between people and government  
  - Panopticons are scary  
- Data is often used to easily **influence** the thoughts, actions, and behaviors of individuals  
  - Attention economy like algorithms used currently for profit, but could be used for political power.  
  - Panopticon  
- Data is often misused by governments to **suppress** civil liberties  
  - Uighurs in China: Patented tech to detect Uighur faces, government alert when a Uighur steps outside 100m of their house.  
- A sense of **autonomy** also plays into privacy, where people deserve some sense in which 

## Informed Consent

If people are giving vulnerable information about themselves, there ought to be transparency measures and proper knowledge.

The government owes at least some transparency to the people, insofar as it isn‚Äôt outweighed by the other values we mentioned. Insofar as the government represents the people, it owes some clear reasoning and transparent processes

# The TSA‚Äôs Role and Program 

## What is the TSA & its Role

- Transportation Security Agency, within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)  
- Role is to provide security for transportation and travel  
  - In this case, TSA is responsible for security of air travel

## Facial Recognition Program 

- In 2020, the TSA began implementing a program to use facial recognition technology as a quicker and more efficient way to go through airport security  
- The TSA has placed this technology in major US airports, scanning both US and non-US citizens  
  - Supposed to be an opt-in system with signage posted near checkpoints (will discuss if this is adequate later)  
- Government-issued ID or passports are scanned, and travelers have a picture taken of them  
- Technology compares the images and the Officer stationed at the checkpoint signs off on the match  
  - If there is not a match, the officer goes through the necessary next steps 

# Data Ethics and the TSA

**We create a Data Ethics framework and use the TSA case study to explain why each point is important and evaluate whether the TSA follows best data ethics practices. This framework could be applied to all presumed innocent civilians.** 

## Data Collection

### Data Ethics

1. Make sure no extra information outside of organizational role is gathered  
2. Where possible, give people the choice to opt-out  
3. Make sure people know what data is gathered (NOT buried in privacy policy)  
4. Proper cyber security to prevent data breaches

### TSA

Using the role we defined above, we will now critically analyze TSA data collection methods. 

TSA harvests (and keeps or transfers): Name, dob, gender, ID type/state issuance, ID number, live photograph, top id matches

In terms of what's going well, the TSA is currently following best practices for cyber security.

Otherwise, the TSA Chief said in 2023 that the agency wants to make this program mandatory for all people. Unless there is good peer reviewed evidence (which does not exist as of yet) and unless the other data practices we are to mention aren't fixed, this is unacceptable. This entirely waives informed consent and any privacy rights, which requires a huge burden of proof on the part of the TSA.

Besides this, just posting that you can opt out isn't enough, as people don't realize what opting *in* means. It is incredibly important that people broadly know what data is being collected and how for it to be ethical.   
Our guess is that if this information were posted, the percent of people using this system would fall dramatically. If this is right, this data is then gathered deceptively, which is pretty awful on its face.

On top of all of this, no data needs to be collected at all, violating the value of privacy. Rather than sending the data to a server, all of it could be encrypted on the device itself and deleted instantly \-- *only* checking whether or not the face matches the ID. Since the system does far more than that, the TSA is beyond overstepping its role. 

## Data Access

### Data Ethics

- Make legally binding or otherwise secure agreements (where possible) that detail the ways data are used. After you collect vulnerable information from someone, YOU are responsible for what happens with it. Don't fuck this up.  
- Make sure internal access to the database is as limited as possible  
- Make sure external access to the database is as limited as possible  
- Make sure people you get vulnerable data from broadly know who has access to it

### TSA

- There are 3 main government organizations that have access to the data from this pilot program: the TSA, Customs & Border Protection (CBP), and The Department of Homeland Security‚Äôs Science & Technology Directorate (S\&T)  
  - **TSA** originally has access to: facial images, biographical data, passport info, known traveler number, departure airport/time, ID type/state issuance, metadata, outcomes  
    - The TSA keeps: metadata (transaction ID, timestamps, quality scores), outcomes (match or no match)  
  - **CBP** has access to: Passport info, known traveler number, live photo, name, gender, dob, departure airport/time  
  - **S\&T** has access to: Name, dob, gender, ID type/state issuance, ID number, live photograph, top id matches  
- The TSA currently allows the Department of Homeland Security to send all of this data to any state or local police departments and private sector departments, which is unacceptable. This far oversteps their role of keeping airplanes safe, and is a substantial breach of privacy.  
- Beyond this, people don't know how their data is being shared (who has access to their data), breaking the value of informed consent.

## Data Usage

### Data Ethics

- Appeal to function of organization  
- Make sure data does not disproportionately impact demographics  
- Do people know where data is going/what it is used for?

### TSA

- Each of the 3 government organizations uses the data in a specific way  
  - TSA uses metadata and outcomes to look at the functionality of the program  
    - TSA deletes unnecessary data after transferring it to the CBP  
  - CBP uses the data to determine whether or not the images and identities match  
    - Data is also used to create the gallery of images to use when comparing for future travel  
    - Unclear whether or not data is deleted \- sounds like not  
  - S\&T uses data to test accuracy of algorithm and program  
    - Data is deleted within 180 days  
  - \*\* Images are deleted but ‚Äúface prints‚Äù are not, making facial reconstruction possible if there were a data breach  
- The usage does appeal to the functions of the organization  
  - Is the inclusion of all organizations necessary for this process?  
- Issue with how data impacts specific demographics  
  - Argument that new algorithms and functions are continually being tested to ensure that specific demographics are not targeted  
- The organizations may be using the data *somewhat* properly, but people do not know what the data is actually being used for  
  - There is limited understanding of who has access and which data points are being used for what  
    - Argument that there is posted signage by security checkpoints or on airline apps/websites  
      - Initial implementation of program was across airports without informing travelers  
      - Not actually significant in informing people of how program works and how individual data is used

# Ways to Make TSA Program Better

## Our Proposed Solution for TSA Program

- Transportation Security Agency

## What Other Nations/Regions are Doing

- Italy: FaceBoarding  
  - Thales (public French IT company)  
  - Program available for all passengers 18 years and above  
    - Passengers must opt into program  
  - Present in 2 Italian airports: Milan Linate & Catana  
  - Travelers use airport kiosks to show documents and scan face  
  - Hope to reduce queues and be more widely implemented in the future  
  - **Relevant distinction**: Italy has an opt-in process limited to specific travelers  
    - US System is closer to opt-out process  
- EU: Entry/Exit System (EES)  
  - Replace physical stamping of passports when crossing between EU borders  
  - Almost all EU countries (a few have opted out)  
  - Not applied to legal residents or long-term visas  
    - Mandatory for non-residents  
    - Could lead to travel restrictions based on data collected  
  - Provide documents, take live photo, scan fingerprint  
  - Data stored for up to 3 years  
  - Launched Oct 6, 2024  
  - **Relevant distinction:** EU system only applies to non-EU citizens or long-term visas, and this only applies to crossing EU borders  
    - US system oversees US citizens as well and is not only at state/national borders  
      - More of a concern with US system for surveillance than EU system

# Alternative Perspectives

## Social Contract: Individual vs Collective Freedoms

- Social Contract suggests that people give up certain individual freedoms for collective protection from a government  
  - This program is an example of security provided by the government  
  - People give up the individual right of privacy for the collective benefit (security)  
- Just because the government is allowed to do something does not mean it should  
  - Members of Congress have written against the program  
- Previously mentioned that TSA Program promotes security but does it in an excessive way which impacts other important values

Case 2 Re-organized LiteTM

The TSA has far overstepped its security related duties, and the facial recognition technology should be disbanded, or at the very least include a much clearer opt-in process.

1). Obligations of the TSA from a data ethics perspective

1. Avoid excessive data collection by only gathering necessary data to its organizational role  
   1. People give up the individual right of privacy for the collective benefit, in this case security  
   2. Excessive security collection harms the individual right of privacy  
2. Where possible, give people the choice to opt-out  
3. When gathering data, make sure people know what data is gathered (NOT buried in privacy policy)  
4. As well as ensuring cyber security to prevent data breaches  
   1. 2015 OPM data leak

2). Assessment of the TSA‚Äôs practices

1. TSA collects basic information and metadata  
   1. Name, dob, gender, ID type/state issuance, ID \#, live photo, top ID matches  
   2. Transaction ID, timestamps, quality scores, outcomes (match or no match)  
2. TSA gives the Department of Homeland security all data (basic info and metadata)  
   1. TSA allows this data to be sent to state and local police departments, and private sector departments   
   2. This is unacceptable and far oversteps their role of keeping airplanes safe  
3. Program supposedly is/is advertised as an opt-in system  
   1. Posted signage at checkpoints explains the opt-in system, but does not detail what information is collected, where it goes, or why ‚Äî just posting you can opt-out isn‚Äôt enough because it is not clear what people are opting-in to\!\!

3). Alternative facial recognition technology systems/practices

1. Italy has implemented, and hopes to implement more widely, a similar facial recognition technology, called FaceBoarding in 2 of its own airports  
   1. Travelers use kiosks to show documents and scan their faces with the intention of reducing queues  
   2. Rather than the US‚Äô system which is closer to a universal opt-out process, instead, the opt-in process is limited to specific travelers  
   3. Only those who want to participate and know what the program is participate in it  
2. Similarly, the EU, and almost all of the EU countries which just a few exceptions, have implemented a entry/exit system (EES)  
   1. The EES replaces the process of physical stamping of passports when crossing between EU borders  
      1. Provide documents, take live photo, scan fingerprint  
      2. Data stored for up to 3 years  
      3. Launched Oct 6, 2024  
   2. However, a relevant distinction between the EES program and the US program we would like to make is that it is not applied to legal residents or long-term visas  
      1. While the this only applies to crossing EU borders for non residents, the US facial recognition screening system oversees US citizens as well, posing more of a concern of excessive, unnecessary surveillance

4). Evaluation of TSA‚Äôs practices based on our framework  
The TSA has far overstepped its security related duties, and the facial recognition technology should be disbanded, or at the very least include a much clearer opt-in process.
