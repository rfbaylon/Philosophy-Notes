## Competition Outline

**Thesis:** States should not implement I.D. verification laws on porn sites but should instead robustly improve sexual education as a more effective means of addressing harmful porn exposure to adolescents  
**Background: Harms of Porn Exposure**

* Currently, the majority (56%) of adolescents have been exposed to internet porn at least once, many as their **first** exposure to sexual encounters  
* Even basic porn exposure can be harmful in a variety of ways  
  * Minors get a warped view of what sex is (hedonistic, fetishistic, normalizing extreme circumstances).  
  * Creates attitudes toward sexual encounters conducive to violence  
    * Teen boys who consumed violent porn were 3x more likely to enact dating violence, girls were 1.5x more likely (behavior matching).  
  * Minorities, especially sexual minorities, are introduced to more sheltered children first in a sexualized, objectifying, or potentially damning environment.  
  * Minors exposed to porn showed higher sexual permissiveness (sex normalized with a misconstrued understanding of safe sex)  
* Despite this, it seems we can’t stop minors from consuming porn without suffering adverse effects

**Harms of ID verification:**

* There is an un-ignorable privacy/security concern with an I.D. requirement  
  * Security is a huge concern for the same reasons any data breach is harmful (Can porn sites be trusted?)  
    * Who has access to the data? Would a third party need to be involved?  
  * An additional risk of blackmail material with leaked IDs (especially with the social stigma/shame of porn consumption)  
* I.D. requirements are an ineffective solution  
  * I.D. laws will be unable to catch all sites and children will be more exposed to more harmful and unregulated content elsewhere  
    * Analogy: Prohibition  
  * There are loopholes that minors committed to accessing porn will exploit  
    * Stealing parental ID’s/faking ID’s  
    * Sharing logins

**Benefits of sex education**

*   
* Minors are introduced to sex in a controlled environment rather than by discovery of a dramatized/fetishized portrayal  
  * Should be shown in the late prepubescent range to generally catch the majority of minors pre-exposure to porn  
* Youth interventions on the negative effects of porn demonstrated a better attitude towards women and relationship responsibility (for boys), lowered narcissism and compulsivity (for girls) and effectively stigmatized consumption with no adverse effects.  
  * (This education also brings greater consciousness to how one is depicted in media and their means of interaction)  
* Porn education including education about queer topics could introduce the idea in a destigmatized, de-fetishised context.  
* Analogy: anti-tobacco campaigns reframing the public perceptions of substances through proper education  
  * Porn, similarly, is addictive but often not stigmatized until later on due to sheltering children from sexual topics

**Counterargument: Ban Porn**

* “If viewing the wrong kind porn is harmful to minors and it’s difficult to stop kids from encountering porn, the most basic solution is to ban all kinds of pornography”  
* However, this is likely not possible  
  * Examples like prohibition not actually blocking the sale of alcohol, pirated content popping up elsewhere (market becomes less regulated)  
    * Can lead to minors encountering sites that are far more harmful and unregulated than the typical websites  
* There are free speech concerns with banning a kind of media outright  
  * Erodes an industry  
  * Inhibits adult autonomy  
  * There are difficulties with identifying porn in the first place   
    * The cinema/art distinction

**Potential Solutions:**

1. Ban Porn Outright  
   1. If viewing the wrong kind porn is harmful to minors and it’s difficult to stop kids from encountering porn, the most basic solution is to ban all kinds of pornography  
   2. However, this is likely not possible  
      1. Examples like prohibition not actually blocking the sale of alcohol, pirated content popping up elsewhere (market becomes less regulated)  
         1. Can lead to minors encountering sites that are far more harmful and unregulated than the typical websites  
   3. There are free speech concerns with banning a kind of media outright  
      1. Erodes an industry  
      2. Inhibits adult autonomy  
      3. There are difficulties with identifying porn in the first place   
         1. The cinema/art distinction   
2.  I.D. Requirement  
   1. There is an un-ignorable privacy/security concern with an I.D. requirement  
      1. Security is a huge concern for the same reasons any data breach is harmful (Can porn sites be trusted?)  
         1. Who has access to the data? Would a third party need to be involved?  
      2. An additional risk of blackmail material with leaked IDs (especially with the social stigma/shame of porn consumption)  
   2. In addition to the privacy risk, we’re suspicious that this wouldn’t actually limit access to porn  
      1. Reiterate prohibition/piracy point (inability to catch all sites \[non-US\])  
      2. Would the requirement of IDs inhibit minors (stealing their parent's IDs/shared logins?)\]  
3.  Better Sex-Ed through Schooling/Public Resources  
   1. Minors are introduced to sex in a controlled environment rather than by discovery of a dramatized/pleasure-based portrayal  
      1. Shown in the late prepubescent range to generally catch the majority of minors pre-exposure to porn.  
   2. Youth interventions on the negative effects of porn demonstrated a better attitude towards women and relationship responsibility (for boys), lowered narcissism and compulsivity (for girls) and effectively stigmatized consumption with no adverse effects.  
      1. (This education also brings greater consciousness to how one is depicted in media and their means of interaction)  
   3. Porn education including education about queer topics could introduce the idea in a destigmatized, de-fetishised context.  
   4. Draw parallel to anti-tobacco campaigns reframing the public perceptions of substances through proper education  
      1. Porn, similarly, is addictive, but often not stigmatized until later on due to sheltering children from sexual topics

Additional (for Counter-Arguments:

PORN FOR TWEENS

- If sex ed is better, the negative effects of porn consumption lessens  
  - The issue is kids wanting to replicate what they see in pornography *because it is the only reference they have for what sex is*  
  - They’re looking for an example of sex because there is such a gap in traditional sex ed programs  
- There should be a new genre of porn: Education Porn  
- Sex ed should teach Porn Literacy (What is real vs what is not?) 

Age-verification **should** be used on porn sites (though it is a *blunt instrument*) 

- Porn Industry consumption is harmful  
  - We are talking specifically about online porn (If you wanna send a sex tape to your friends, you can do that and that speech is in no way restricted by the laws up for discussion \[except cp, obviously\]).   
  - Increases sexual violence  
  - Should prolly find studies

    - [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21046607/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21046607/)  
    -   
- Making access more difficult for children won’t stop consumption entirely but *will* likely lessen it  
  - Why do we expect it to lower child consumption? How much will it lower it by?   
  - This is the first step to showing that we as a society take the harms of pornography seriously.   
- The burden put on adults is not unreasonable (we ask for age verification for alcohol purchases, entry to certain events, etc)  
  - The real issue bothering adults is the lack of anonymity that verification would cause.   
    - It’s not really anonymous anyway (Your phone/computer IP address can be traced). This can help crack down on cp.   
    - Who would have access to the porn list? The porn sites. They know that porn is a taboo (Social Shame)  and have an interest in keeping the porn list private or that site risks losing its viewership.    
      - Name drop companies that could work with the porn sites to keep privacy data protected (eg. Plaid)  
- Age verification should be done through some form of document (ex Real ID) rather than facial age assessing technology.   
  - Some people don’t look their age (in both directions) so this would not be an effective method of accomplishing the goals that the age verification rules are supposed to accomplish (preventing minor access).   
  - Yes this is really a thing that’s being talked about, [UK porn watchers could have faces scanned](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-67615719)  
- Did video stores ask for ID to rent X-rated movies? (back when that was a thing…)

A literature review of the research:

They conclude basically what Mark was saying: we need longitudinal and experimental studies 

A framework?  
The case: the harms of porn of young people watching porn

- hitting/choking case studies

The case against: the privacy cancer  
Provide a solution, we need a good faith effort+porn harms 

Norms from porn impact consent
