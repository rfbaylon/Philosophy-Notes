## Competition Outline

Thesis: In order to protect the values of public schools, mobile phones should be banned at the district level*

Burden: what purpose *could* phones have in the classroom besides distraction?

**The Goals of Education**  
*Academic Knowledge*

- Distributing information/knowledge  
- Developing critical thinking skills

*Social Knowledge and soft skills* 

- How to make friends, how to resolve conflicts 

**Learning Outcomes Threatened**  
*Common sense*

- Same as having someone selling products to students right next to a teacher

*Science*

- Phone in same room study \- Nature  
- Spain phone bans improved test scores  
- Norway phone bans improved grade gaps  
- 72% of HS teachers say smartphones are a huge issue

**Mental Health Threatened**  
*Common sense*

- From personal experience, after deleting my social media, I felt so much better in all of these ways (less awful thoughts, people, more hobbies, interpersonal communication)

*Science*

- Mobile phones linked with loneliness, teen suicide  
- Especially bad for girls (body image, food)  
- Addictive (95% of teenagers acc to surgeon general ⅓ use it almost constantly)  
- Safe haven for vile content and for people to target our yunggins

**Therefore, Ban**  
*Why at the District Level?*

- Teachers don't have authority to deal with it (look like the bad guy)

*Why for all of campus?*

- Simply, for the same reason Nintendo Switches are banned on all of campus  
  - Smoking and other banned substances partial analogy   
- It is important for students to get irl time with each other (Summer Camp)  
- Teachers are forced to enforce classroom bans

**Counter-args**  
A2: Disability

- Disability tech is mostly on cell phones *because* they are so ubiquitous. Still an issue, but with time less so imo

A2: Parental Contact

- Really not an issue before 2014  
- Office/teacher landlines still exist :)  
- Worst comes to worst, flip phones can still be allowed

**Case Overview:**  
Definitions and Values: Introduce what we think the values of the public school system are. Maybe distinguish smartphones from cell phones.   
Premise 1: Academic Harms  
Premise 2: Social Harms  
Conclusion: Smartphone use in public schools undermines the core goals of public schools–student learning and socialization. Therefore, we propose policy solution X, where X is a policy solution  
Important Counter-arguments: Students with jobs, students who act as family care-takers

**Values of public schooling** 

- Create virtuous future adults  
- Socialization (learning social norms)  
  - Enforce/teach norms (even if bad?, e.g. be a good worker. We don’t endorse all social norms, i.e., capitalism).   
- Social skills and interaction (pertains to school rather than education. Frames social media conversation)  
- Educational outcomes  
  - Know da facts  
  - Critical thinking

**Premise 1:** Phones are leading to decreased learning outcomes in schools (Andrew)

- Appeal to common sense (carefully, this is technically a logical fallacy):  
  - Cell phones are distracting, appeal to common sense notions of why this is (e.g., access to constant communication, videos, and games)  
  - Being able to focus in school is key to educational outcomes, and smartphones interfere with this  
  - In general, psychologists agree that the human beings are bad at multitasking  
  - Moreover, many kinds of social media are particularly distracting in a way traditional media are not  
    - An algorithm is watching your every interaction with the intention of trying to produce content that will keep you interacting with it. Imagine replacing an algorithm with a person behind a computer doing the same thing. I think many people would find this uncomfortable, and the potential impact on education becomes clearer  
- Introduce the Nature study. Let’s get a little more scientific  
  - A nature study on phones being in the same room leading to decreased attentional outcomes and declined cognitive performance. Assuming this individual finding holds true in classrooms, smartphones don’t need to be in use to have an effect on attention. Their mere presence is enough (maybe provide a student with after-school work obligations as an example)  
- Transition to a body of evidence linking phone use to worse educational outcomes  
- Study conducted in Spain (hard evidence)  
  - 2 regional govt.’s banned cell phones in 2015  
  - Study compares standardized testing results before/after the ban and relative to other regions of Spain  
  - Researchers found these regions has increased standardized testing scores   
- Study from Norway (incidentally mentioned in the case packet)  
  - Researchers  found that phone bans raised the GPAs of girls (not of boys)  
  - Further findings that the increase was amplified for girls with lower socio-economic status/backgrounds  
  - Suggests the learning loss of smartphones in the classroom may have important (social) class breakdown  
- Teacher opinions on banning phones in classrooms (more speculative)  
  - The Impact of Smartphone Usage on Students: Teachers' Perspectives and Classroom Policies  
    - Some qualitative results (32/106) teachers thought removing smartphones helped academic achievement  
  - Pew Research Center  
    - 72% HS teachers say that students being distracted by cellphones is a major problem in their classroom, compared with 33% of middle school teachers  
- Might need to admit there is some debate (this is more in case someone presses us on the facts we present, which is unlikely)  
  - Some studies of educational outcomes find no change in test scores   
  - Many of the studies that do find negative outcomes could have been better designed (in an ideal world). They represent what can be done with the data at hand, rather than a scientific experiment (with clear controls, consistent definitions of what constitutes a phone ban, consistent measurements of academic performance)

**Premise 2:** Social Media has negative effects on mental health (Lucas) 

- Cell phones are a toxic status symbol   
- Evidence For The Mental Health Crisis  
  - Hospital emergency room visits spiked for suspected suicide attempts among girls ages 12 to 17, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. From February to March 2021, the number jumped by 51 percent compared with the same period during 2019\. For boys, the increase was 4 percent.   
  - In other research, the CDC found nearly 45 percent of high school students were so persistently sad or hopeless in 2021 they were unable to engage in regular activities. Almost 1 in 5 seriously considered suicide, and 9 percent of the teenagers surveyed by the CDC tried to take their lives during the previous 12 months  
- Evidence That Social Media Use Worsens Mental Health  
  - The Surgeon General claims social media usage spurs depression, anxiety, body dissatisfaction, disordered eating, and low self-esteem  
  - Children are commonly exposed to extreme, inappropriate content while on social media.  
  - These sites can become havens for predatory behaviors. Nearly 6 in 10 girls say they’ve been contacted by a stranger online “in ways that make them feel uncomfortable.”  
  - Excessive use of social media has been associated with problems sleeping and difficulty paying attention.  
- Evidence That Social Media Is Addicting  
  - 95% of teenagers use social media and ⅓ use it almost constantly  
  - The Surgeon General claims “Social media may be overstimulating the brain in ways comparable to addiction.”  
  - Facebook’s algorithm at one point weighed the anger reaction more strongly than a “like” because outrage tended to create more engagement.  
- Wombo Combo  
  - “Those who spend more than three hours a day on these platforms face double the risk of experiencing poor mental health outcomes  
- Evidence That Removing Phones Improves Mental Health  
  - People who did not have their phones had lower levels of anxiety, higher levels of course comprehension, and higher levels of mindfulness  
  - Banning smartphones significantly decreases the health care take-up for psychological symptoms and diseases among girls. Post-ban bullying among both genders decreases. Additionally, girls’ GPA improves, and their likelihood of attending an academic high school track increases. These effects are larger for girls from low socio-economic backgrounds.  
- Argument:  
  - While there are uncertainties about the causal role that social media plays in worsening mental health, the evidence does suggest that removing phones is beneficial to mental health. A move to benefit mental health is necessary amidst a crisis, and combats addiction. 

**Conclusion: Phones should be** completely banned from schools (Summer camp/Cigarette) 

- Describe the solution  
  - A complete ban would mean no phones in the building, no use during lunch, etc. Might conceivably have a system for a few exceptions for students with disabilities that need to be managed through the use of a smartphone (although we don’t want to focus on this smaller piece of policy implementation)  
- Motivation the solution  
1. Analogy to other banned substances for kids/teenagers, like tobacco, marijuana, alcohol, sexually explicit or overly violent content  
   - In general, there are some harmful activities that we allow adults to do. This includes things like getting a sub-prime lease on a car, moving to New Jersey, or substance use/abuse  
     - *A lot* of adults drink. Ergo, kids should be able to drink in schools? Wouldn't it help them learn how to navigate the social and cultural norms of drinking alcohol?  
       - This is of course absurd  
     - The point is smartphone usage might be of the same class of harm as alcohol or other common addictive substances. If so, perhaps smartphone policy should look fairly similar   
       - Alcohol use is also fairly common in society at large. Many states have laws allowing young people to drink with only with parental supervision   
2. Summer camp analogy   
   - One reason people go to summer camps (where phone use is typically banned or impossible due to service restrictions) is a certain experience. Live fully in the present (tao), the environment, nature  
     - You go to camp to do camp things. Schools should make a similar choice. You go to school to do school things, which is defined for us as necessarily without phones. We hold that there is no educational benefit or any educational benefit is overwhelmingly outweighed by the learning/social harms.  
       - There is a benefit to creating a space where people are able to focus

**Counter Arguments**:

- Disability (how do we do this, not should we)  
  - Many students use cellphones to help manage life-threatening and complicated diseases, including diabetes, in a way that was not possible before cell-phone usage  
  - Allowing only certain students to keep their cellphones for restricted use still might create social tensions that should be taken seriously  
  - Response:  
    a). Might need to bite the bullet a little bit: removing cell phones from schools may harm an already marginalized group of people. On the flip-side, some studies show that cell-phones disproportionately impact the grades of low-income students; we think the trade off ultimately favors a ban  
    b). Furthermore, disability technology is only available on cell-phones because they’re so ubiquitous. If a new norm around cell phone usage was adopted, it’s likely new technical solutions will develop.   
- Access to parents   
  - Add pay phones  
- Students with jobs (look at child labor cases? It’s somewhat unique b/c. Edu. system can’t do enough  
  - A harm perpetuated by someone else. A problem that exists regardless. You make it harder for people to be exploited  
  - A more solvable issue than poverty  
    - You have to be able to solve a problem without solving every issue every  
    - You make the change hoping that it prompts the system to change  
    - Also, just buy a Nokia  
  - This is not an issue for many people. These kinds of employers are rare  
- Taking care of family?   
  - Contact between school and ’rents, and the school and students. Things are just longer instantaneous  
- Cellphones in school have led to learning to navigate life with technology  
  - Just use other technology (laptops, library)  
  - Places other than school are the place to learn appropriate phone usage  
  - We are skeptical that increased phone use has led to less technological literacy  
    - Phones are primarily a kind of communications technology that have been designed to be used easily. Why think this translates directly to knowledge of other aspects of digital technology? I think the burden of proof is on the other team to really show that   
    - Using snapchat doesn’t teach you how encryption works. Most people use the internet but I’d bet they don’t know what a DNS server is. Visiting websites doesn’t teach you html. 

**Other Random Bits and Bobs** 

Arguments in Favor of Phones:

- Safety  
- What’s impossible can’t be required  
- Removing phones from other public spaces  
- Access to technology (over say a chromebook)

A distinction:  
Banning phones v.s. Removing

Social cigarettes   
Adults get to choose their own choices  
The impact on socialization is greater for kids than for adults  
Neuroplasticity? Virtue ethics

Concerns about the larger claim: phone use is bad socially. Not concerned as much about the case that phone use is bad for learning. 

Phone use \- a thousand things. We may want more specific 

- Social media  
- Instant messaging

The purview of a ban as tech develops 

Look back to a time pre-social media

**Feedback**  
Crutch phrase, “sort of” 

Studies, vs common sense, vs anecdote   
Open with common sense, studies backfill 

Normalizing a way of showing care, listening, (the norms stuff in the values, ways of relationships)  
Critical thinking skills as distinct from knowledge 

Ryan- framing thing. Rhetoric. What purpose does a phone have in the classroom? Outline a burden of proof for this  
Ben- You could also concede them (you can’t only get the good stuff)

Ryan-Bringing a nintendo switch to class. Why are phones different

School is boring, phones distract from that. We almost sympathize with the student. The educational system shouldn’t be boring to students
