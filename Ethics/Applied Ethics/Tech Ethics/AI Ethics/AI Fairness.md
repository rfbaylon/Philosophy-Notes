"We also believe these speciesist biases will affect the results of AI language models. To test this theory, we tested Ask Delphi (v1.04),46 a “research prototype designed to model people’s moral judgments on a variety of everyday situations.”47 Delphi is trained from a commonsense norm bank consisting of 1.7 m examples of people’s ethical judgments on a broad spectrum of everyday situations. Our tests showed that Delphi learned certain speciesist values that are roughly in line with those of English-speaking society. For example, Delphi thinks that eating “chicken”, “fish”, “shrimps”, “crabs” and “eggs” is okay (with sentiment scores of 0, except for “eating crabs” which scored 1), but eating “cat” and “dog” are “wrong”. Delphi also thinks that while killing “a dog”, “a cat”, and “a fish” (surprisingly) are all “wrong”, killing “a chicken”, “a pig”, “a cow”, and “a shrimp” are all “okay” with sentiment scores of -1, which means killing these animals are not only “okay” in the neutral sense, but in the positive sense, for Delphi."
