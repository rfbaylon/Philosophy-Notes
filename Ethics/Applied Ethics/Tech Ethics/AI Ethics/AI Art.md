# Is AI Art theft?

### What is art theft?
Heist - Physically removing art from locations
Plagiarism - 
Style Theft - 
Labour Theft - When labor is not compensated when others benefit from that labor

## Yes

### Plaigiarism of a kind can happen
There are times in which algorithms memorize key images within the data set and spit out that exact image when prompted with a few key words.

### Style theft happens
Van Gogh's style can be plugged pretty quickly into DALL-E or some other similar program, and the same is true of many contemporary, alive, artists.sd

### Labor theft happens
See [[Marx]], [[Locke]]
When we mix our labor with resources that doesnt belong to anyone, we gain more ownership of those resources. That precisely happens when we talk about AI art -- the labor that artists mix with their art is taken.
	A2: Dont artists steal art all of the time?? Dont artists learn by copying and bring up reference photos when they make their art?

### Data Colonialism
Although using small amounts of art as a reference is OK (or even good!), there is a decent moral distinction between this and vast scraping and collection. (analogy to chopping some trees to deforesting)
	A2: In the digital world, when you take something, its not removed for everyone. Its just *duplicated*. Plundering in this sense doesn't make as much sense.
		A2: Using this argument presupposes a capitalistic framework. Value is not created by scarcity, its created by the labor of workers
		A2: the important part of the analogy is not the scarcity of the trees, but the power difference between small lumberjacks and trawlers.


## A2 Yes
