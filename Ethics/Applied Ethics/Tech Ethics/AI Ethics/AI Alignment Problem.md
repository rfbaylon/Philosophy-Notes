## Delphi as a Case Study
[Link to Delphi](https://delphi.allenai.org/)

Delphi has been rapid redeveloping
"instead of relying on prescriptive ethics which is taken top down, we leverage descriptive or applied norm representation from a bottom up approach."
Delphi is incredibly finnicky in terms of prompt engineering and can be entirely contradictory
Delphi engineers hammer in the fact that there are severe limitations within Delphi

### Delphi has 3 loci of ethics
* The programmers
	* Mistakes acknowledged
		* Inadequate notice of intent
		* Reliance on static crowdsourced judgements
		* Biased responses included and undetected
		* Failure to anticipate adversarial users
	* Authors mention in the paper that prescriptive ethics is arbitrary and useless
	* Mistakes Unacknowledged
		* failure to appreciate sources of relevant expertise
		* Failed to represent the intended demographic
		* failures due to limitations of the training data
		* general failures or scientific methodology
	*  
* The machine
* The survey-takers 

Allen argues that machine intelligence needs to be complemented with machine wisdom
* The breadth of understanding knowledge, skill required for good judgment
* The metacognitive awareness required to come up with a rational strategy for dealing with ones own limits

Lessons learned:
* Wisdom needs to be coproduced
* Machine conceptualism needs expert opinions
* Test with adversarial users
