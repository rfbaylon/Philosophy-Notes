| Actual    | 1. Currently existing (An alive human)          | 2. Beings that will exist due to a particular choice (A couple's to-be child)                                   |
| Potential | 3. Future humans (Population 10 years from now) | 4. Beings that could have existed, but never do (A child any couple could make but dont care to think about it) |
Narrow views focus on the inevitable, broader views focus on all quadrants.

- The Total View cares about quadrants 1, 2, 3, 4
- The Prior Existence View cares about quadrants 1, 3
- The Actualist View cares about quadrants 1, 2, 3

# Natalism

#### "If you have the opportunity to bring a happy person into this world, you ought to do so"

## Natalism
See [[MacAskill]], [[Ord]], [[Kagan]], [[Nagel]], [[Singer]]
This will be the Totalist position


## A2 Natalism

### Argument from Autonomy
Under the Total View, we are obligated to create beings that have happy lives, whether or not we want it. There is no power for the parents who will dedicate 18 years of their lives to raising a child. 

# Neutralism
This could very well be the wrong term

#### "You do not have an obligation to bring happy people into this world, but there is nothing wrong if you do"

## Neutralism
See Narveson
This will be the Actualist and Prior Existence View


### Person Affecting View
"we are in the buisness of making people happy, not making happy people" - Jan Narveson
Look into "Asymmetry Intuition in population ethics" Making a baby and bringing it into a hellish world would be immoral, but would this mean we are morally obligated to bring a baby into a good world?
	A2: How can we care about climate change if we dont care about future people?
	A2: How can the asymmetry intuition make sense in the first place??
	A2: Under this view, it would not be wrong to bring an abjectly miserable child into the world, but it would be morally obligatory to euthanize it. Does this not seem paradoxical? [[Practical Ethics]], 89


### Actualist View
Only beings that are actual ought to be considered



## A2 Neutralism

### Any Prior Existence View Leads to Contradictions
See [[Kagan]]

Outcome 1: Person A is decently happy
Outcome 2: Person A is slightly more happy than Outcome 1, but Person B will live a miserable life. 

If outcome 2, then both A and B are actual, in which case outcome 1 would be better overall. But if Outcome 1, then only A is actual, so B's interests are irrelevant. Since B's interests are irrelevant, we ought to choose what is best for A, which would be Outcome 2

Thus, neither choice is morally acceptable under this view!


# Antinatalism

#### "You have an obligation *not* to bring children into this world"

## Antinatalism
See [[Benatar]], [[Schopenhauer]]

### The Asymmetry Argument 
- Being born happy is good
- Being born sad is bad
- Not being born and avoiding a happy life is neutral
- Not being born and avoiding a sad life is good

### The [[Deontology]] (Strong Autonomy Argument)
The *only* reason one would bring a child into the world is to fulfill a prudential imperative (to make the parents happy). If someone decides that they want a child because it would make them fulfilled and because they think they can give their kids a good life, this fails the CI. By bringing a child into the world for your sake is using them as a pure means to an end, as they cannot consent to birth. You are abusing their rational potential for your own preference of being a parent.

### Autonomy (Weak Autonomy Argument)
If you took 100 people and put them in a room against their will, and gave 99 of them $100,000, but cut off one persons arms and legs, then it doesn't seem intuitively pleasing such that (despite increasing net utility) this would be an ethical thing to do, simply because nobody signed up for being in the room. The analogous case to antinatalism is that the 99 people are people who love life and its fruits, but one person is in abject pain for their entire life due to something they did not consent to.
