Case study

A pregnant person is offered a medicine that could take a medicine that removes a disease from the child in utero. This case is an *alteration*.
Another person is considering getting pregnant. If she decides to get pregnant in 6 weeks, a child without a disease will be born. If she decides to wait 10 weeks, the chlid will be born without a disease. This case is a *substitution*.

Though these seem similar, we cannot appeal to the wrongness of the second case with harm. The child concieved at 6 weeks was not harmed because otherwise they would not exist.
