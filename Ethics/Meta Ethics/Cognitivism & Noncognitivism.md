# Cognitivism
Morality is truth apt. They can be true or false
You can be a cognitivist [[Moral Realism]] (some statements of morality are true independent of belief) or [[Moral Realism & Antirealism]] (all moral statements are strictly false) (AKA error theory)

See [[Frege]], [[Geach]], [[Sidgwick]]


### [[Frege]]-[[Geach]] Embedding Problem
#### Or, The Problem of Unasserted Contexts

(P1) **If** tormenting the cat is bad, getting your little brother to do it is bad  
(P2) Tormenting the cat is bad.  
_Ergo_, getting your little brother to torment the cat is bad.
.
	This formulation of 'bad' creates a [[Private Language]] ([[Wittgenstein]]) which is incomprehensible to the outside world. 
	Using a conditional in P1 means that a noncognitivists cannot make sense of the statement. Because it is a conditional, no feeling or emotion is expressed in P1.
	The noncognitivist has to hold that the above proof is invalid as the usage of "bad" in P1 (as part of a conditional) is different than its usage in P2 (expressing emotion). This is a [[Fallacy]] of equivocation

This is what Geach has called The Frege Point: “A thought may have just the same content whether you assent to its truth or not; a proposition may occur in discourse now asserted, now unasserted, and yet be recognizably the same proposition” (Geach 1965, 449).

### [[Sidgwick]]'s argument from marginal cases
 Clearly there is a distinction between me saying "This food is delicious" and "this food is morally correct," these are *obviously* different things. ([[The Methods of Ethics]], 27)

Given noncognitivism, ethical statements cannot be criticized [[Practical Ethics]], 8

# Noncognitivism

## Noncognitivism

See [[Ayer]], [[R.M. Hare]]
Our moral judgements express feelings and emotions, they have no truth value
Noncognitivists agree with error theorists: there are no moral facts, but disagree on truth aptness.

Ayer: Stealing money?!? BOOOOOO!!!!!!!!
Hare: Stealing disgusts me! 

### [[Moore]]'s Open Question Argument


## Quasi-Realism
Branch of Noncognitivism

Technically, moral statements dont talk about anything truth apt, but it still makes sesne to talk about moral propositions as if they were truth apt.

## A2 Noncognitivism

### Emotivism Is Circular
[[MacIntyre]]
"Moral judgements express feelings or attitudes!" "Oh, what kind of feelinsg or attitudes?" "Feelings or attitudes of approval!" "Oh, what kind of approval?" "..." ([[After Virtue]], 12-13)

### Emotivism Confuses Preference and Evaluation
See [[MacIntyre]]
Utterances of preference depend on who utters them while utterances of evaluation  are not similarly dependent on the context of their utterance. These are two incredibly distinct kinds of statements, and to collapse them gets rid of a lot of meaningful and important language. 

### Emotivism confuses Use and Meaning
See [[MacIntyre]], Ryle
When an angry school teacher yells at a student that seven times seven equals forty-nine, the *meaning* of the statement is just descriptive. What the teacher uses the sentece for is to show their frustration, anger, and to make the child learn the sentence. When we are talking about ethics, we ought to focusing on the meaning of the statements such as "murder is bad" rather than what we use the phrase to do. ([[After Virtue]], 13). When someone attempts to make moral statements, they are describing the way the world is.
