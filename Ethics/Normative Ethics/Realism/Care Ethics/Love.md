## A2 Love is an Emotion

### Abuse
This defintiion of love allows love and abuse to be mutually inclusive. As often happens in abusive relationships, the abusing party does legitimately feel affection towards the abused -- they have the emotion -- but they dont act like they love them. It would make sense in this case to say "He doesnt really love you if he hurts you"

### Accountability & Self Determination
Often, there is a notion that one "falls in love." That we have no control over our feelings. An objectivist account (a la [[hooks]]) would allow for a more liberatory and intentional kind of love. We choose who we love for reasons, and those reasons can be grounded. We dont just happen to fall into it, we choose it for ourselves and others.  

# Love is Ethics
[[hooks]]
Love is as love does
### Love is Ethics
[[hooks]]
Love is built from care, affection, recognition, respect, commitment, trust, and communication. hooks' main beef is reducing love JUST TO affection.
An implication is that there is no deep disinction between romantic and platonic love.
#### Knowledge
Movies pose two strangers falling in love without talking to eachother, fuck without talking about their wants and needs. In popular culture, it seems, part of the appeal of love is the mystery of the other person. "It is ignorance that gives love its erotic and transgressive edge" ([[All About Love]], 95). This misses the point that in order to treat someone properly, you must intimately know them. You cannot love someone without knowing them.

# Unorganized

Often, after a breakup, friends will tell you that you dont need a partner, that you have everything you need already. Though nice, this isnt true -- people need people to love and be loved by.

### Aristotelean Account
That which is loved is that which receives affection from someone
	[[Nichomachean Ethics]] 8.1
"By love, we mean an extreme affection"
	[[Nichomachean Ethics]] 9.10

"Indeed friendliness is considered to be justice in the fullest sense... What is more, people think that good men and friends are the same"
	[[Nichomachean Ethics]] 8.1
"The good man is ready to lose money on condition that his friends shall get more; for the friend gets money but he himself gains fineness of character, so he assigns himself the greater good"
	[[Nichomachean Ethics]] 9.8

##### Friendship required for Happiness
The perfect man would not choose to have all good things to himself because man is a social creature and naturally constituted to live in company. So, friendship is required.

"For a given person the existence of his friend is as desirable, or almost as desirable, as his own"
	[[Nichomachean Ethics]] 9.9
##### 3 Kinds of friendship
1. Friendship based on utility (eg connection for a job)
2. Friendship based on pleasure (eg one night stand)
3. Perfect friendship based on goodness (eg besties)
The 2 former friendships will not endure and are not confined to the good. "*Friendships in the primary proper sense is between good men in virtue of their goodness*, whereas the rest are friendships only by analogy"
	[[Nichomachean Ethics]] 8.2

##### Unequal friendships?
If person A and B are unequally good (A>B), A and B's friendship must  be proportionate. A must love B only insofar as B is good, and B must love A insofar as A is good. 
For this reason, friendship with God is impossible for God is perfect.
	[[Nichomachean Ethics]]  8.7
We cant be friends with inanimate objects, they cannot return affection
	[[Nichomachean Ethics]] 8.
##### Self Friendship
If you are a good person, you should love yourself!
Most people say they should love their best friend most because they wish you well and for its own sake. But both of these conditions are best fulfilled by ones self.

1. Life is in itself good and pleasant
2. We are aware that we think
3. If 2, we are aware that we exist
4. Awareness that we exist is pleasant
5. Existence is pleasant
6. The friend is a second self
7. Therefore, "for a given person the existence of their friend is as desirable, or almost as desirable, as his own"
	[[Nichomachean Ethics]], 9.9

# Specific Love <3
## Self Friendship
[[hooks]] says that all love is conditional *except* for self love. Love is conditional for others because we cannot control their actions. We can exercise control over our actions though.
	A2: This doesnt make sense to me. Is my love for others dependent on their actions? Even though I *could* love myself unconditionally does not mean its necessarily unconditional.

"One of the best guides to how to be self-loving is to give ourselves the love we are often dreaming about recieving from others"
