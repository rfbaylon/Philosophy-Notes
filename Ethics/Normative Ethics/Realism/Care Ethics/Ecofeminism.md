## Ecofeminism

### Entangled Empathy
See [[Gruen]] , [[Entangled Empathy]]

"A type of caring perception focused on attending to another's experience of wellbeing. An experiential process that involves a blend of emotion and cognition by which we recognize we are in relationships with others and are called upon to be responsive and responsible in these relationships by attending to another's needs, interest, desires, vulnerabilities, hopes, and sensitivities" [[Entangled Empathy]], 3

### Speciesism through Sameness
[[Singer]] and [[Regan]]'s approach to animal ethics depends on sameness via the [[Name That Trait]] argument, arguing that because animals share our capacities in some way, we ought to care about them. Sameness should not be the metric by which we count individuals. Instead, it should be based on the relations we have with others. ([[Entangled Empathy]], 36)
