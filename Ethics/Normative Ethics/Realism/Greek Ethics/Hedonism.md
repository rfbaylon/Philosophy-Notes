See [[Epicurus]]

There are two types of pleasure:
1. kinetic pleasure: the pleasure that is the experience of one's pain being removed
2. static pleasure: the pleasure that is the condition of being without any pain at all
"Epicurus thinks that the absence of all pain constitutes the upper limit of pleasure. Beyond that limit pleasure can vary and be of different kinds, but it cannot be increased or expanded" (OME 38)

1. Every animal, as soon as it is born, seeks and enjoys pleasure
2. If every animal, as soon as it is born, seeks and enjoys x then x is the good
3. Therefore, pleasure is the good of every animal

*necessary desires*: desires that necessarily cause pain when not satisfied
*unnecessary desires*: desires that do not necessarily cause pain when not satisfied
*natural desires*: desires that we have just in virtue of being human animals
*unnatural desires*: desires that we have in some sense because of society's influence
Epicurus think that the only desires we should keep are the necessary or natural desires.
