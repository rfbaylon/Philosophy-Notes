See [[Epictetus]], 

The core of Stoicism is acknowledging the difference between *impression* (feeling something as good or bad) and the *assenting* to that impression (recognizing that the sensation is in fact good or bad). 

### Eudaimonism
[[Aristotle]] claims taht the virtuous life is the good life, the happy life. Stoics take this a step further and claim that virtue is the only thing that can make one happy. Acting virtuously, therefore, is both the only thing in your control *and* that which makes you happy.

1. What necessarily benefits us is good
2. Only virtue necessarily benefits us
3. Thus, only virtue is good -- not health, money, social status, anything.

1. What necessarily harms us is bad
2. Only vice necessarily harms us
3. Thus, only vice is bad -- not sickness, poverty, death, anything.

## Parts of Practice

### Impressions and Beliefs
Evaluative impressions: x seems to be good/bad
Evaluative beliefs: x is good/bad
A belief is the ASSENTING to or DENYING of an impression. Impressions are not up to us, but beliefs are! One of the few things we can do is assent or deny. 

"Keep in mind that what injures you is not people who are rude or aggressive but your opinion that they are injuring you... Start, then, by trying not to get carried away by the impression. Once you pause and give yourself time, you will more easily control yourself.
	[[Encheiridion]], 20

"If someone in the street were entrusted with your body, you would be furious. Yet you entrust your mind to anyone around who happens to insult you, and allow it to be troubled and confused. Aren’t you ashamed of that?"
	[[Encheiridion]], 28
"In things to do with the body—food, drink, clothes, housing, and servants—take only what you need, and cut out everything that is for show or luxury."

### Disregard "Not Up to Us"
"Right now, then, make it your habit to tell every jarring thought or impression. Next, examine it and test it by these rules taht you have. First and foremost: does it involve the things up to us, or the things not up to us? And if it involves one of the things not up to us, have the following response in hand: "not my business" 
	[[Encheiridion]] 1
"Whoever wants to be free, therefore, should wish for nothing or avoid nothing that is up to other people" 
	[[Encheiridion]], 14
"Your job is to put on a splendid performance of the role you have been given, but selecting the role is the job of someone else."
	[[Encheiridion]], 17
Wherever I go, I will be fine, because I was already fine here—not on account of the place but as a result of my principles, and I am going to take them with me. No one can take them away from me; they are my only possessions, irremovable ones that are enough for me wherever I am and whatever I do.
	Discourses, 8

### Social Modesty
"If the conversation turns to a philosophical point, stay mainly silent, since there’s a great risk that you will immediately spew up what you haven’t fully absorbed. When your silence is taken for ignorance and you don’t react, then believe me, you have made a real start on the philosophical enterprise."
	[[Encheiridion]], 46
"The signs of a person making progress are these: criticizing nobody, praising nobody, blaming nobody, accusing nobody, and saying nothing about oneself to indicate being someone or knowing something."
	[[Encheiridion]], 48


# A2 Stoicism
### A2: Incoherency of Virtue and Vice
If I punch you, it would be wrong to say I acted maliciously since I didnt actually harm you (under a stoic view). The harm was your fault since you chose to take it as a harm. Because I never caused any harm, then, its hard to say that my action was vicious.
