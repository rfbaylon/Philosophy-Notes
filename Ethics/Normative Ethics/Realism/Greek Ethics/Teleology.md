[[Moore]] claims that the fundamental question of ethics  is "What things are goods or ends in themselves?"

#### Reciprocity of Means and Ends
"Rather than being unequivocally asymmetric, the relationship is reciprocal. For our final ends derive a certain instrumental value from the very fact that they are terminally valuable. One reason for pursuing them is, of course, that they are (by hypothesis) valuable in themselves. However, pursuing them is also justified in part because pursuit of an intrinsically valuable state of affairs is itself intrinsically valuable."
