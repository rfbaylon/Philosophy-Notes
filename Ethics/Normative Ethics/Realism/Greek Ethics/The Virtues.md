### Friendship

#### Aristotelean Account
"Indeed friendliness is considered to be justice in the fullest sense... What is more, people think that good men and friends are the same"
	[[Nichomachean Ethics]] 8.1
"The good man is ready to lose money on condition that his friends shall get more; for the friend gets money byt he himself gains fineness of character, so he assigns himself the greater good"
	[[Nichomachean Ethics]] 9.8

##### Friendship required for Happiness
The perfect man  would not choose to have all good things to himself because man is a social creature and naturally constituted to live in company. So, friendship is required.

"For a given person the existence of his friend is as desirable, or almost as desirable, as his own"
	[[Nichomachean Ethics]] 9.9
##### 3 Kinds of friendship
1. Friendship based on utility (eg connection for a job)
2. Friendship based on pleasure (eg one night stand)
3. Perfect friendship based on goodness (eg besties)
The 2 former friendships wil not endure and are not confined to the good. "*Friendships in the primary proper sense is between good men in virtue of their goodness*, whereas the rest are friendships only by analogy"
	[[Nichomachean Ethics]] 8.2

##### Unequal friendships?
If person A and B are unequally good (A>B), A and B's friendship must  be proportionate. A must love B only insofar as B is good, and B must love A insofar as A is good. 
For this reason, friendship with God is impossible for God is perfect.
	[[Nichomachean Ethics]]  8.7
We cant be friends with inanimate objects, they cannot return affection
	[[Nichomachean Ethics]] 8.
##### Self Friendship
If you are a good person, you should love yourself!
Most people say they should love their best friend most because they wish you well and for its own sake. But both of these conditions are best fulfilled by ones self.
## Intellectual Virtues
There are two parts of the rational soul, one which is variable (scientific) and the other which is invariable (philosophic)
	[[Nichomachean Ethics]] 6.1

### Wisdom
"Wisdom produces happiness, not as medical science produces health, but as health does. Wisdom is a part of virtue as a whole, and makes a person happy by his possession and exercise of it"
	[[Nichomachean Ethics]] 6.12

### Prudence
"[[Socrates]], though he was partly right, was also partly wrong in his inquiries, because he was mistaken in thinking that all the virtues are forms of prudence, but he was quite right in asserting they *imply* prudence"
	[[Nichomachean Ethics]] 6.13
