"We do not hold beliefs in the sense which some say that belief is assent tosome unclear object of investigation... the nature of expernal existing objects is always unclear... as to what things are like in their nature, we shall suspend judgement (I.xiv.59 cf78)... "We are not able... to asset what each thing is like in its nature" (I.xiv.123)

### The Basic Argument
There are 10 conditions of the world which substantially change the way we see things. These are differences between:
1. animals
2. people
3. the senses
4. circumstances (eg, rested/tired; sober/drunk)
5. positions, intervals, and places
6. admixtures
7. quantity
8. relativity
9. frequency/rarity
10. persuasions/customs/religion

Just using the first mode as an example:
1. Animal receive different appearances of the same things
2. If animals receive different appearances from the same things, then we must suspend judgement as to what those things are *really* like, i.e., beyond appearances. 
3. So, we must suspend judgment as to what things are *really* like

### The Upshot
For those that have clear ideas of the virtues or the good or bad, they are always upset. Either they don't have it and feel hungry or dismayed or they do and feel constant anxiety about losing it. "Those who make no determination about what is good and bad by nature neither avoid nor pursue anything with intensity; and hence they are tranquil" (I.xii)
