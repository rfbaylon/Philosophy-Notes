## Core Tenets - "Everything is Sacred"
![[Pasted image 20250126105650.png]]

**Everything is Sacred**: Everything that exists is capable of standing in relation to something else. Insofar as it does, *that thing matters*. It would be wrong of us not to recognize that these things matter (read 'depend') if not to us, then to someone or something else.
In other words *If X is (metaphysically?) dependent on Y, Y matters to X*


There is nothing more foundational in terms of value than anything else. Everything is a flat web of value. [[Burkhardt]] focuses instead of the *amount* of value something has, rather the *type* of value a relationship has. 
1. You can (and do) form relationships with nonhumans
2. These relationships may require different things of you but the beings with whom you are i relation are equally valuable
3. These relationships may (and will) change over time and so will our obligations as a result
4. These obligations are the resuilt of a constant negotiation with those we are related to.

### Localization
Indigenous ethics also fights against delocalized ethics, in favor of localized ethics.
- Delocalized: Treating oneself or an object in an abstract, alienated being, stripped from relations (the *in-itself*)
- Localized: The embedding of oneself or an object into a relational and local context


## A2 Relational View

### This is just relativism

### Bad relationships?
Some relationships are bad and should not be valued while other are good. How can this framework deal with bad relationships like cancer-me

### Prioritization
How can you prioritize anything if everything has the same amount of value?
	A2: Not everything is equally important at all times. It depends on contexts 

### Descriptive, not Normative
This view views things as "waht matters from x perspective." This is a descriptive, not normative framework. It doesnt tell us what *should* matter from x perspective.
