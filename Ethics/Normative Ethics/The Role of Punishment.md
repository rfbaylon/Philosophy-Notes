# The Role of Punishment

## Retribution
"We are punishing you because you hurt this person, you deserve to be hurt aswell"

## Restitution
"We are punishing you because we want you to learn why its wrong to hurt people"

## Prevention
"We are punishing you because we want to make an example of you to other people considering similar things"
"We are punishing you because we dont want you to hurt another person again. With you being punished in jail (e.g.), you cant hurt anyone
