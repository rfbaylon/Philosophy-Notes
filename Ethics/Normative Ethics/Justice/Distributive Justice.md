## Ecological Distributive Justice
[[Wienhues]]
Notably, justice prescribes how humans ought to act towards nature, but not nature towards humans. 

"every standardized human has a claim to an equal share of –overall finite – ecological space which should be at least enough to fulfil X under conditions of moderate scarcity"

See [[Wienhues]]
[[Taylor]] claims that this wouldnt make sense if we take seriously the right to self defense.
