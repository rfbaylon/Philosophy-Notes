## What exactly are we distributing?

# Environmental Justice
Environmental justice is defined as
- Freedom to: clean air, water etc
- Freedom from: toxins, pollutants

### A2: Anthropocentric
Seeing environmental beings as resources or goods is anthropocentric and unjustified.
	Hernandez, Fresh Banana Leaves
### A2 Misvalues Land
See [[Indigenous Ethics]]
Losing farmland that is a resource is horrible for a farmer, but it is made much worse if that farmer has a connection to the land. This latter loss is called 'ecological grief' (Hernandez) and is compared to the loss of losing a pet. Traditional EJ cannot account for this.
	Hernandez, Fresh Banana Leaves

### Access isnt Enough
See [[Sovereignty]]
You can have access to 'environmental goods' and that's cool, but if you have rightful ownership(?) over it, then merely having access to these goods isn't enough. Sovereignty is needed. Traditional EJ cannot account for this harm.
	Hernandez, Fresh Banana Leaves
## Ecological Justice
### Ecological Space
[[Wienhues]]
Ecological space is the currency of ecological justice. This is defined in human terms by Hayward, 2007 as "‘all the environmental goods and natural resources that play a part in the socio- economic life of humankind"
	Cited in [[Ecological Justice and the Extinction Crisis]], 73
