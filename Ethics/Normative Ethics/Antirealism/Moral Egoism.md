# Moral Egoism

This is *distinct* from [[Moral Realism & Antirealism]], although on face value they seem similar

While moral anti-realism claims there is no moral truth, Pure Egoism claims there is a moral truth, but that truth is just "that which is best for me is good"

### [[Moore]]'s Argument from logical contradiction
"Egoism asserts that  *each* persons happiness is the sole good - that a number of different things are *each* of them the only good thing there is - an absolute contradiction!" ([[The Possibility of Altruism]], 86)
	There is an incredibly good [[Moore]] #Quote on this page, its just *incredibly* long and I cant find a copy paste. #Cite #WIP 

### Moral Egoism is a Contradiction in Terms
Ethics is the study about how we ought to treat other people and other beings. Finding these answers and studying these debates are what the field of ethics does. Since egoism only wants to focus on the self and has nothing to do with how we treat others, it isn't within the field of study of ethics. 
You can study what makes you best off, but to call that a study within ethics is a miscategorization. 

### Egoism is purely intuitive
[[Moore]]
Egoism is purely intuitive, there are no positive arguments for it.
