## Demodulation

### Demodulated learning has better outcomes
Demodulated learning (teaching that doesnt follow a strict order) has much better learning outcomes for students (Cornell & Bjork), though it is more difficult for them. 
[[Ahrens]] argues that this is because modulated learning coddles the students mind and spoonfeeds them information rather than allowing students to make their own connections with the material. Allowing for this flexibility and exploration between concepts in a nonlinear order is crucial for learning

[[Ahrens]] argues that this needs to be reflected in notes as well.
