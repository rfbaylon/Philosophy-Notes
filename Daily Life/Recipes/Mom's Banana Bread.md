Halfed the sugar, didnt notice a difference. Worth doing in the future

Added half scoop protein powder. made it thicker, but not bad. Its not a lot of protein though.

DO NOT add 4 bananas without anything to counterbalance

tried doubling oats, halving sugar: tastes like sawdust. is very firm. jaw workout. REALLY filling though. try 3/4 cup oats w 1/2 sugar or 1 cup oats with full sugar
