### [[Heidegger]]ian AI

> In Heideggerian terms, the failure of \[good old fashioned AI] was that it relied on building machines that “know that” versus “know how.”

Dreyfus theoriezed that the rational project of defining a strawberry in terms of its properties (red, conical, dimpled) would be an inferior way of teaching AI what it is. Rather, showing AI strawberries and having it resolve the contexts and relationships of the berry was a better way to teach. This is what neural networks and deep learning are.

> If the gauntlet Dreyfus threw down is a viable one, then we’ve unequivocally fallen on one side of his “conceptual revolution.” We haven’t just built working AI systems — we’ve falsified rationalism as a convincing view of the world, man, and intelligence itself.

> And yet, in a stubborn irony, the parties building, investing in, and overall theorizing about AI remain mired in an ontology oriented towards deciphering eternal, objective forms. Marcus Aurelius’s Meditations, a how-to on living with as much uninvolved detachment as possible, remains a perennial bestseller in Silicon Valley. Sites like Astral Codex Ten and other rationalist blogs and Substacks are de facto required reading by people in the space. Like Sam Altman, they champion effective altruism as an implementation of rule-based rationalist ethics that can be codified and universalized. It hardly bears mentioning that so many of AI’s most aggressive advocates subscribe to libertarianism, an economic paradigm predicated on the principle that human beings are fundamentally rational agents of utility maximization.

>A Heideggerian AI would do this literally. Like any compelling interlocutor, it is not a time-saver, but a highly skilled [time-waster.](https://components.one/posts/gamer-and-nihilist-product-hunt). It keeps the conversation going the way all good conversationalists do, by drawing disparate concepts together in unexpected ways and threading together new yarns of meaning. It can provide answers but, more importantly, it asks the right questions that allude to an ever broadening world while still allowing that world to remain mysterious. It would be built on epistemic humility and its uncertainty deepens rather than solves that mystery.
