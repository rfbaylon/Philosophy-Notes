## Definition and Values
Digital Minimalism defined:
	Philosophy by which you carefully select technologies that are used and happily miss out on the rest. In other words, have a high bar for bringing technology into your life.
		[[Digital Minimalism (Book)]], loc 433

3 Principles of Digital Minimalism:
1. Clutter is incredibly costly to our social and work lives
2. Optimization (or, decluttering) is important for getting valuable work done
3. Intentionality in a work flow or in negotiating friendships is satisfying
	[[Digital Minimalism (Book)]], loc 513

## Practice

Some small changes:
- Dont bookmark facebook, bookmark facebook messenger or facebook market place specifically so you dont have to deal with the home interface.
- Batch notifications on your phone. Instead of getting all notifications all of the time, schedule notification summaries once or twice a day.
	- this increases presence when not texting (See [[Deep Work]])
	- This also forces more conversation (See Conversation in [[Attention Economy]])
- In class, full do not disturb. Otherwise, do not disturb sans important texters and calls. Tell people if they need you to call
- Create conversation office hours. Set up consistent times each day where anyone can call you to talk. Also, reply to texts saying that "I would be interested in chatting more at X:00, call any day :)" ([[Digital Minimalism (Book)]], loc 1909)
- Schedule low quality leisure time into your calendar. Be intentional with how and when you do it and for how long. ([[Digital Minimalism (Book)]], loc 2370)
- 90% of facebook profit comes from mobile phones, likely meaning about 90% of time spent on facebook is mobile. For reducing your own consumption, it could be worth trying to only use desktop so that it is less distracting. 
- Block apps off for certain times of day using apps like freedom.to and limit them for a total amount of time. 
### The Detox
The goal: Remove all optional technology from your personal or professional life for 30 days to reevaluate the importance of each tech.

Step 1: Define your rules well. (loc 836)
	"optional" = significant harm to daily personal or professional life.
	Specify *how* and *when* you will use each piece of technology.
Step 2: Detox
Step 3: Reintroduce
	The important part here is to reintroduce technology in ways that get the most value with least downside. Hopefully after the detox, you are able to value each technology from a more neutral perspective. It should pass through the following filter:
		- Serves deep value
		- Is the best way to achieve that value
		- Is constrained by rules on *how* and *when* you use it

### Leisure Lessons
All found in [[Digital Minimalism (Book)]]
Leisure lesson 1: Prioritize demanding hobbies and interests over passive consumption. They will lead to more fulfillment in the end.
Leisure lesson 2: Physical crafts and hobbies are more meaningful than digital ones (loc 2151)
	I actually hard disagree on this -- the book does not provide any reasoning for this claim besides 'we already spend so much time on a screen.' Im not sure what differentiates writing a novel on a computer with drawing on paper.
Leisure lesson 3: Seek structured, social, real-world interactions. (loc 2245)
