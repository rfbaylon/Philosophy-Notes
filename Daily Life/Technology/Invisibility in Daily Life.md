There is a part in Dewey's *Art as Experience* that was talking about friction being required for attention.

This seems right to me. Think about the pipes under your sink which go ignored unless they leak, or consider the electrical panel that you pass every day in your apartment that literally becomes invisible due to its constancy. 

Though I have not come close to reading his works (yet), Heidegger has a famous example of a hammer to make this point. When a carpenter holds a hammer, it ceases to be a long piece of polished wood with a blunted metal tip. Rather, it transforms into an extension of the carpenter and becomes internal to the human experience of hammer*ing*. The carpenter can essentially forget about it and carry on conversations with friends when in this mode because the hammer is part of them. As soon as the hammer breaks mid-swing, this blurry process ends and it becomes a mere long piece of polished wood and a blunted metal tip again.

"An environment that was always and everywhere congenial to the straightaway execution of our impulsions would set a term to growth as surely as hostile would irritate and destroy. Impulsion forever boosted on its forward way would run its course thoughtless, and dead to emotion. For it would not have to give an account of itself in terms of the things it encounters, and hence they would not become significant objects. The only way it can become aware of its nature and its goal is by obstacles surmounted and means employed; means which are only means from the very beginning are too much one with an impulsion, on a way smoothed and oiled in advance, to permit of consciousness of them. Nor without resistance from surroundings would the self become aware of itself; it would have neither feeling nor interest, neither fear nor hope, heither disappointment nor elation. Mere opposition that completely thwarts, creates irritation and rage. But resistance that calls out thought generates curiosity and solicitous care, and, when it is overcome and utilized, eventuates elation... We all recognize that a balance between furthering and retarding conditions is the desirable state of affairs--provided that the adverse conditions bear intrinsic relation to what they obstruct instead of being arbitrary and extraneous."

Observation as well as overt action is subject to inertia and moves in the line of least resistance. A public is formed that is inured to certain ways of seeing and thinking. It likes to be reminded of what is familiar. Unexpected turns then arouse irritation instead of adding poignancy to experience. Words are particularly subject to this tendency toards automatism. If their almost mechanical sequence is not too prosaic, a writer gets the reputaiton of being clear merely because the meanings he expresses are so familiar as not to demand thought by the reader"

"There is always a gap betyween the here and now of direct interaction and the past interactions whose funded result constitutes the meanings with which we grasp and understand what is now occuring. Because of this gap, all conscious perception involves a risk; it is a venture into the unknown, for as it assimilates the present to the past it also brings about some reconstruction of that past. When past and present fit exactly into one another, when there is only recurrance, complete uniformity, the resulting experience is routine and mechanica; it does not come to conscousness in perception.

"Events that are familiar and customary are those we are least likely to reflect upon; we take them for granted"
