# Friendship

### [[Aristotle]]
"To be a friend, it is a said, you must wish goods for his own sake (and that to be reciprocated, and both people to be aware of it" [[Nichomachean Ethics]], 7.2.3

##### Kinds of Friendship
- Pleasure Friendship: A loves B because A takes B to contribute (in some way) to A's pleasure
- Utility Friendship: A loves B because A takes B to contribute (in some way) to A's good
- Character Friendship: A loves B because A takes B to be good

"Complete friendship is the friendship of good people similar in virtue; for they wish goods... to each other insofar as they are good, and they are good in their own right... Now those who wish goods to each other for the friend's own sake are friends most of all; for himself, but not coincidentally. Hence these people's friendships last as long as they are good; and virtue is enduring... These kinds of friendships are likely to be rare, since such people are few. Further, they need time... they cannot accept each other or be friends until each appears lovable to the other and gains the other's confidence"
	([[Nichomachean Ethics]], 7.3.6)

### [[Aristotle]]
From his conception of character friendship, self love is the loving of one's self in so far as they are good. This includes:
- Of one mind with oneself, desiring the same things in one's whole soul.
- Shares in one's own distresses and pleasures
- Wishes good to oneself for one's own sake
- Finds it pleasant to spend time with oneself
