## Against Strict Planning

### Expertise neglects strict rules
See [[Ahrens]]
When we see experts in a field performing their expertise, they will rarely follow strict rules and instead follow their gut. Analytic planning fails in 2 ways:
1. Very slow, time consuming
2. intimate experience rather than abstract armchair reasoning is a prerequisite for valid expertise.

Empirics: 
In a study on CPR, CPR teachers failed to differentiate experts from nonexperts performing CPR while lifeguards and doctors clearly distinguished the subjects. The teachers saw any deviation from their teachings as failure, neglecting important nuance in the practice (Study author was Dreyfus)

### Write Multiple Things at Once
If you write multiple manuscripts at the same time, left over parts of one will help build the other. Ideas that may not be relevant in one place may find a home in another or shine a different light on the existing ideas there. In total, multiple papers at once will work like the German concept of a *Verbund,* or a factory by which the waste of one product is directly used to make another, thus increasing total efficiency.
