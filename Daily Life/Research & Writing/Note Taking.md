	In fields I am not familar with,
	1. Look at title
	2. Look at abstact
	3. Look at prestige of institution

Easy part is finding articles, hard part is finding reliability of papers

# Zettelkasten Notes

### About Luhmann

### Consider the Context
When we take smart notes, we need to consider the context we want to stumble across the information again in, not the strict subject. 
	See [[How to Take Smart Notes]], loc 1682

### Thinking happens on pen and paper, not in the brain
Something that [[Ahrens]] forcefully posits is that thinking is far from internal, or at least exclusively internal. Thinking happens on a keyboard or pen and paper. Writing things down is crucial for deep thinking and refection. 
	Richard Feynman supports this in an interview saying that his workbooks are not products of his thoughts, but *literally* the thoughts themselves ([[How to Take Smart Notes]], loc 1454)
	This links closely with the flavor of externalism that [[Chalmers]] and [[Clark]] argue for 
		See [[Internalism & Externalism (Mind)]]

Forcing you to write down important parts of notes rater than highlight them allows you to more clearly differentiate similar concepts from different authors (created unexpected connections in the process). It also allows for deeper understanding of the subject at hand. 
	[[How to Take Smart Notes]], loc 1763

Another benefit of this mindset is that it forces us to write what we *know* rather than what is on the top of our head at the moment we sit down to write. When this happens, we tend to unduly favor ideas, papers, and arguments that we have heard more recently rather than looking deep into our research.
