Amsterdam is like if every part of Boston was Beacon Hill or Back Bay.

I stayed at ClinkNoord, which I kind of recommend against. It was huge and socializing was difficult. It felt commercial. But for the price and locatoin, it wasn't bad. It used to be an insane asylum, and you can tell.

Favorite part of the trip was biking to Haarlem through the coastal National Park near there. Ian and I saw a beautiful and sandy forest, the North Sea, and much of the Dutch countryside. Would recommend.

I recommend against the Sex Work Museum. It was a gimmick.

I learned there was a big difference between a bikable and a walkable city. Before I had fused those concepts in my head. 

There was an antique market which had a lot of cheap and delightful things, but I cannot (and could not) for the life of me remember where it is or what its called. 

Overall, I think I would recommend against Amsterdam. It felt comfortable and not too different from Boston. Im sure I could get a similar experience here for a lot cheaper. Its especially not worth a flight there, but it could be worth dropping by for a few (3-4) days if you are in the area.
