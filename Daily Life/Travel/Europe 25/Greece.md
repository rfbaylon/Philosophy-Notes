### Athens
Philosophy Related:
- Acropolis
	- I wish I went to the acropolis museum. I thought it was too expensive when I was there, but I wouldve loved it.
- Agora
- [[Aristotle]]'s Lyceum
	- 5 Euro entry. Cool for me, but Im not sure I would recommend it to someone whos not into Aristotle.
- [[Plato]]s Academy
	- Just a pile of rocks now, tucked away in a poorly maintained park in one of the rougher parts of Athens. I think Im glad I went, but for sure not worth it if you're not super into Plato. 
- Pnyx Hill (the democratic square)
	- I didnt do this, but IMO it didnt seem worth it
- Cynosarges Gymnasium Site (Where Antisthenes Lectured)
	- Didnt go. TBH I have no clue who Antisthenes is. 

**Exarchia** was the coolest neighborhood in Athens, I loved it. It used to be an autonomous zone. Its intellectual, artisitc, leftist, and a lot of cool antique stores. Exarchia is my top recommendation for Athens. 

### Aegean Islands
8th: spend morning in Athens, Explore Paros, Night in Paros
9th: spend all day in Naxos, return to Paros for the night 
10th: Check out of paros, head to Milos, spend night in Milos 
11th: Check out of Milos, Explore milos, Head to Athens in the afternoon for the concert

Unfortunately, ALL of the following islands would have been better picks, but they were all booked out:
- Milos
- Ios
- Syros

UPDATE:
I ended up doing:
- 2 nights paros 
	- I hated Paros -- it was culturally and literally hollow. ATVing around the nature-y parts was awesome though. For the same experience but better, go to Naxos.
- a day in naxos
	- Naxos was nice! Not super developed once you got outside of the port, and that made it nice. I rented a bike and went to the nude beach a bit south. 
- partying all night in ios
	- I do not recommend Ios. It was made exclusively for partying, and there are no greek people on the island. There are only slutty australians. If thats what youre into, then go for it, but its just not greek. 
### Ionia
I WISH i could have gone to Kefalonia, but there is only ONE hostel, and its booked out. There were reasonably priced family hotels, but they were family hotels. 

When deciding between Ionia and Albania, I went with albania. The same exact water, but a third of the price. I dont regret not going to Ionia, but wish I spent a few nights in Corfu. Corfu is apparently filled with hippies and beautiful nature. Everything I heard from travellers though was that you need a car/scooter on Corfu, or you cant do anything interesting.
