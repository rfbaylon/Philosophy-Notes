Prague is the most beautiful city I have been to in my life (so far).
Every building is magnificent. What would be the centerpiece of Boston is tucked behind an alley in Prague.

Its a suprisingly young city, so the nightlife was good. I only went to one club, the Dog Bar, which had solid live music, but closed pretty early (2am). 

I stayed at Elf Hostel which was well priced (22/night) and one of the best hostels Ive stayed at. Happy hour beers were 50c per bottle. 

DO NOT do a Beer Spa. No where close to worth the money.

Beer is cheaper than water in prague. 

I did a run around the perimeter of Prague 1, and highly recommend that. I saw a lot of Prague in a really short amount of time. 

I recommend going to the top of some building to see the rest of the city. Jake and I did the Clock Tower and Prague Castle. The clock tower was cooler because it was more downtown, and also cheaper.
