Bol and Hvar are sleepy beach islands. Personally, I dont think I needed to go to either, but the average tourist would likely love them. Bol was nice because it was VERY cheap, had a similar vibe to Hvar, and had a hike to the highest point of the Adriatic, which I found worthwhile. Solo travlling, I dont think I would have gone to either but they were fun with family.

Split is a nice beach town. I feel like I got everything I wanted out of Hvar and Bol out of Split, but it still had younger and urban side to it that I appreciated. 

Plitvička Lakes was easily the most beautiful place i’ve ever been. Though you can do the whole thing in a day easily, I would have liked to redo it over and over. 

One or two nights is all you need in Zagreb

Take a war tour with CAUTION! Nobody there wants to talk about the homeland war, and it is offensive to talk about it openly. There is one person in all of Zagreb -- a historian who was young during the war and whos father was a soldier -- who is willing to talk about it. I took his tour. He is using the money to build a museum to teach local children about the war, but fears right now that the museum will be burned down as soon as it is opened.
Perhaps that knowledge isn't meant to be revealed to tourists yet. Im not sure. I have it now, but I have complicated feelings about that.

If I were to do Croatia again, I would want to visit Slavonia -- its apparently really cheap, has the best food, and is lively. Also, a town on the east (starts w a V?) was the site of the bloodiest battle of the homeland war.
