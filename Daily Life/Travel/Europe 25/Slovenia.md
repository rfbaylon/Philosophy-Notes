Triglav national park

Mount Triglav looks awesome, but its going to be very cold (even in June), and also requires climbing gear. Neither jake or I are ready for a hike like that right now. 

The valley of seven lakes is the "heart" of the park, and probably the best option with the least elevation gain. Its about 16 miles out and back. [This hut](https://sedmera.si/) is right at the midpoint for 30 EUR/ night. The most popular trailhead is **Panina Blato**, and a free bus runs from **Bohinj**. 

Best bet is likely half day trieste, come into Bohinj, wake up early for hike tomorrow.

UPDATE: Huts book out quick. we didnt get one. We are going to use the Pod hostel on Lake Bohninj as home base.
