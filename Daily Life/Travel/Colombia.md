1. **Bogotá**   
   (I spent 3 days there at the beginning of my trip and two days before I flew back home)  
   1. *Things to see/do*  
      1.  Beyond Colombia tours  
         1. I did the general city tour the first time round which I recommend to get your bearings of the city.   
         2. The tour guides are super knowledgeable and because you get to walk through central areas like la candelaria, you can scope out places to eat/hangout for later.   
         3. When I went to Bogotá the second time round, I did the Colombia conflict tour which I LOVED because it was a smaller group and you could get really in-depth answers.   
         4. I was the only one on that tour that was doing it at the end of their trip (instead of at the start) but I’d recommend doing it at the end (if you can) because it helps connect the dots between everything you learn in other cities/places.  
      2. Monserrate   
         1. I didn’t hike it but people who did told me it’s about 1h20 to do and it’s completely free (I think it's closed on tuesdays?).   
         2. Apparently it’s meant to be a doable hike but the altitude will get you especially if you’re newly arrived from somewhere much more flat.   
         3. They have a cable car and a funicular which is about 30K COP for a return ticket.  
         4.  The cable car was under repairs when we went so hopefully you get better luck\! I think in theory you can go up with one mode of transport and down the other because it’s the same price (or you can pay 15K and walk down).  
      3. Walk around La Candelaria  
         1. Lots of fun shops and galleries around. I enjoyed window shopping in the vintage stores and spent some time reading in some of the bookstores (I really liked siglo).  
         2. MAMBO (museum of modern art Bogotá)   
         3. Fragmentos (memorial museum with contemporary art commemorating the FARC peace deal)  
         4. Museo de Bogotá (museum about the history of the city)  
         5. Museo Botero (has Botero’s private collection of European art as well as famous Botero works)  
         6. Museo de Arte Miguel Urrutia (art museum with lots of free workshops (only in ES and you probably have to register online beforehand)  
         7. Gabriel García Marquez Cultural Centre   
            Check if they have events going during the time you’ll be there (usually there’s cool book launches or really interesting people talking). They have an AMAZING bookshop and definitely worth wondering about reading different bits and bobs. Make sure you head to the top floor for the really nice view.  
         8. Museo del Oro (gold museum \- it was really interesting to learn how important gold was to Colombia’s history and the religious significance it had in indigenous cultures).  
         9. Pasaje Rivas (marketplace with artisan bits and bobs from all regions of Colombia. I was told that a lot of the shops were started by internally displaced people (due to the conflict) who came to the capital which is why there is so much variety)  
         10. Mercado calle 10   
             Across the road from pasaje rivas is literally the most insane marketplace (it stretches over 10 cuadros) I saw in Colombia (please keep your phone and wallet out of sight). There are so many fun snacks to try there but that place is the definition of sensory overload.  
         11. Bogotá botanical garden  
         12. Teatros   
             There are so many theatres in Bogotá especially in *la candelaria* area of the city. Search up teatro and see what’s on and catch a show \- you’ll always meet cool locals there and they can most likely tell you if there are other cool events happening in the city during your time there. I went to teatro libre but honestly just go off on what seems like the most entertaining show rather than the theatre itself.   
         13. Biblioteca Virgilio Barco (public library with insane architecture)  
   2. *Where to eat*  
      1. La Concordia market (go with people and buy bits and bobs and share, the general beyond Colombia tour does a stop off there and you can buy food then)  
      2. NATIVA (vegan, they do menù del día for like 20K COP which is a steal)  
      3. La puerta falsa (traditional food but often with a long queue)  
      4. Origenes cafe (cute breakfast spot)  
      5. Jimenez bistro (they have a good sandwich deal for lunch and also a nice quiet spot for a drink)  
      6. Il fuoco (pizza)  
      7. Madre (I got a pizza but they have a bunch of other dishes).

   3. *Where to stay*   
      1. Botanico Hostel (definitely more of a hippie, townhouse vibe and quite social. This is the one I would recommend the most to stay at).    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
      2. Viajero (less social than botanico but has a more modern interior and you can also get the 3 nights and get the 4th night free deal).  
      3. Masaya \- didn’t stay there but heard good things.   
      4. Selina \- didn’t stay there but seemed very busy and were organising lots of events.   
   4. *Other tips:*   
      1. This is going to sound very stupid from me but I was not prepared for how cold Bogotá was or the altitude. It was a bit of a shock to the system leaving English summer and going to a city that rained just as much as London in the autumn and was like 10+ degrees colder than home (at the time) haha.  
      2. In terms of altitude, using cocoa leaves (you just suck on them and you can get it from a shop in paisaje rivas) does help a lot and I wish I knew that when I first arrived rather than discovering it on my last day. Other than that you’ll just have to rawdog it and you’ll get used to it quickly.    
2. **Cali** (we were there for 4 days, 5 nights)  
   1. *How to get there from Bogotá*   
      1. We took a Bolivariano overnight coach to Cali which was meant to be 12 hours in total. I would only recommend that coach company for a journey of that distance/duration because you get TVs, wifi, fully reclining chairs, a very clean toilet, your bags are safe etc..   
         The only con of that journey was the fact that it ended up being a bit over 14 hours because of traffic. In hindsight I think that was due to the strikes on the motorway that blocked key roads around cities across all of Colombia. The strikes are pretty much over now and when I took an overnight coach from Medellín to Bogotá at the end of the trip, we arrived 2 hours early.   
      2. There are flights from Bogotá to Cali and I would assume they’d be around €40 with bags included (it could potentially be more if you fly during the weekend or book the day before the flight).  
   2. *What to do/see*  
      1. Beyond Colombia city tour  
      2. San Antonio area (it’s where most of the hostels are but there’s so many pretty houses and shops to explore. I didn’t go but apparently there’s a park with cat statues that people liked (??)).  
      3. Teatro mulato cabaret  
         A must-do (\!\!\!\!). They have a show every sunday and I think the tickets were like 30k COP each (potentially it might be cheaper pooling people together to buy a table). They have world champion salsa dancers in the show and they also have these men (??) who are professional dancers that come up to everyone to dance which is a great way to learn. After the show, the floor is open to everyone and you can dance for the whole night.   
      4. Topa tolondra (salsa club with live music)  
      5. Rincón de Herberth (salsa club)  
      6. Malamaña (salsa club)  
      7. Calle del pecado (on a Friday\!\! It’s a salsa street party which is another must do)  
      8. Boulevard (salsa street parties during the weekend)  
      9. Espacio 1060 (club with rooftop terrace)  
      10. Punto parlante ([instagram](https://www.instagram.com/puntoparlante/)) \- basically what you need to do is stalk the account and the DJs that are featured because I think tickets are only advertised last minute/you’re invited by someone already going??  
      11. Donde Fabio (salsa afters vibe)  
      12. Bosque el descanso \- forest with some creeks   
      13. Cerro de las 3 cruces \- fun hike to do with a good viewpoint of the city. PLEASE, please, please go in a mixed gender group of at least 5\. There were two girls from our hostel that went alone together and were robbed at machete-point in broad daylight in front of other travellers.   
      14. Pance river \- fun river day to hang with people from your hostel  
      15. Feria de Cali \- if you’re in Cali in the last week of the year, you NEED to go. It’s like Colombia’s answer to the Rio Carnival.     
      16. In the first two weeks of August, there’s a black culture festival in Cali (I can’t remember the name).   
   3. *What/where to eat*  
      1. Try Aguapanela   
         You need to get it at this one specific stall in Plaza de Caicedo. I don’t think the stall has a name but also I think it’s the only place in the square that does it so you won’t miss it.   
      2. Zea Maíz   
         Probably the best arepas I had in Colombia. You need to try the arepa palestina and also a shot of this sugarcane liquor that has medicinal herbs in it called *viche curao*. I think they make it in-house and I regret not buying a bottle as a keepsake.   
      3. Alma & Cafe (vegan place that do a 20K COP menu del dia)   
      4. Mi tierra (Colombian food)  
      5. Amasijo (brunch vibes)  
      6. Alebrije   
      7. La galería la alamera (marketplace but go to donde basilia)  
      8. There was a peruvian place in the San Antonio area that I can’t find again (so maybe its closed?). But it had no ceiling and made good ceviche.   
   4. *Where to stay*   
      Viajero   
      This viajero has a salsa school in the hostel which is so convenient. It’s definitely a party hostel and it was the place where I made friends that I constantly bump into at later points of the trip. They also organise a party bus on Fridays where they take you to the boulevard and then to a club which was lots of fun.   
        
   5. *Other tips*  
      1. Cali was definitely the most unsafe city of the trip and where I feel like you would be most likely to get robbed (do not have your phone out walking down the street). I personally had zero issues and didn’t feel particularly unsafe (a big part of that is because I’m black and speak Spanish so I weirdly had more privilege in this situation) but it was definitely the city where I heard the most stories.   
      2. If you’re coming to Cali, it’s so important to coincide your trip with a weekend because the nightlife is definitely the highlight of the city.   
      3. Do salsa classes\!\! The city is all about salsa and the individual classes are so cheap (not to mention how many free group classes there are across the city and in hostels). 

3. **Salento** (we spent about 3-4 days there)  
   1. *How to get there from Cali*   
      1. There are no direct routes to Salento so we took a coach from Cali to Armenia and then from Armenia we took a local bus to Salento. The trip was about 5 hours in total (minus the breakfast/toilet break we took in Armenia). You can’t book the Armenia-Salento bus online, you have to pay in person.   
   2. *What to do/see*  
      1.  Cocora Valley hike   
         1. The best way to do it is to join your hostel’s whatsapp chat and join a group going on the day you want to go.  
         2. The best amount of people for a group would be 10 so you can all perfectly fit into one jeep.   
         3. I’d recommend heading to the main square for 8am and a return ticket for the jeep is 50K COP per person (please don’t lose the ticket\!\!).   
         4. There’s two routes for the hike. There’s a more mountainous one that’s about 13km and then there’s the shorter one which is a loop.   
         5. I recommend doing the loop anticlockwise because you still get to go very high up and you can enjoy the view of the palm trees at the end rather than the beginning which to me feels more satisfying. Also on the loop you can stop at a waterfall (you can’t swim in it unfortunately).   
         6. Although the 13 km hike is harder, you don’t get THE view of the palm trees from what I’ve heard. If you’re a really experienced (or clinically insane) hiker you could potentially do both hikes in one day (I met a swede that did that and I was in shock).     
         7. There’s an entry fee to the valley which I think was around 20k COP (ask your hostel reception for the exact amount). You also need money for the hummingbird enclosure which is another 20k (it’s basically unavoidable paying it on the loop trail).   
         8. The hummingbird enclosure is definitely worth stopping at so you can have your lunch and see the birds. Also you can get coffee or hot chocolate with cheese included with your ticket. The ticket is basically a donation so you’re helping them continue to preserve the birds’ environment.   
         9. Pack lots of water and a lunch and don’t hire a horse because some of them look like they’re not treated well.  
      2. Play tejo (at la cancha in town)  
      3. Coffee Farm tour   
         There’s one that’s about 30-40 mins walk from town but if you can go to another one I’d recommend doing that instead. The tour was fine but the English language guide was very passive aggressive and started shit-talking our group in Spanish which ended up being very awkward when he saw me speaking Spanish with another person working at the farm. Alternatively if you do end up at the one and you speak Spanish, do the tour in Spanish which is cheaper and the guy doing that one is lovely.   
      4. Miradores \- there’s a bunch just outside the town and it’s worth climbing up there for sunset  
   3. What to eat  
      1. Cumana Bistro  
         I’m a fiend for Venezuelan arepas and they make AMAZING ones. Really good veggie/fish options there as well and my advice would be to sit at the window table at sunset because the view is absolutely stunning. I recommend the pelua arepa (and that recommendation stands for any Venezuelan arepa place you go to).   
      2. Donde laurita (Colombian food \- I really liked the bandeja paisa there)  
      3. Wabi Asian Kitchen (Japanese food)  
      4. Botanica bar \- such a great place to watch the sunset and get drinks. There’s this drink that they do (I can’t remember the name) but it has lulo and aguardiente and I cannot stress how much you need to try it (even if you hate aguardiente). Also they do really good passion fruit spritz.    
   4. Where to stay  
      1. Viajero   
         Big shocker lol. But we preferred to keep accommodation simple and with viajero you know what you’re getting. I really liked this one because the view from the garden deck into the forest was gorgeous. Salento is absolutely tiny so you’re never more than a 5 minute walk away from anything. It’s quiet (but I think virtually every hostel in that town is) but they do hold social events in the evening which are busy and the bar is very nice.   
   5. Other tips  
      1. I didn’t do this but a lot of people visited neighbouring towns like Filandia that have similar gorgeous architecture and some people did coffee tours from there.   
      2. Whether you’re travelling from the north to Salento or from the south (Cali) to the town, I think it’s a needed city break and helps break up long stretches of travelling quite nicely.   
4. **Medellín** (I went there twice: both trips for 4 nights)  
   1. *How to get there from Salento*   
      1. There’s a direct coach that leaves twice a day from Salento to Medellin. Ask your hostel receptionist for the times and organise accordingly (unlike us lol).   
      2. If you do miss the direct coach, there’s always a bus leaving to Pereira every 30 mins or so (around 12k COP) and from there you can buy a coach ticket to Medellin. I recommend buying in person because you don’t know when you’ll arrive in Pereira exactly and I’d recommend getting food for the journey there before boarding.   
      3. Warning, if you’re vegetarian there are no substantial meals that are veggie in Pereira bus station (so maybe it’s worth picking up food in Salento before going).   
      4. The bus journey from Pereira to Medellín is around 5 hours and the coach driver takes a 30 min break at a service station (you can buy snacks and go to the loo there. There’s also a restaurant but we didn’t bother).   
   2. What to do/see  
      1. Walk around Poblado  
         There are so many cute shops and lots of local designers. I don’t know how often it is but on some Sundays there’s a farmers market outside of Viajero.   
      2. Real City Tours   
         If you get Dio, you’re incredibly lucky (he might be on tour in Europe because he’s a full time tattoo artist). He’s incredibly funny and super knowledgeable about the city. He’s born and raised in Medellin and it was insane hearing his childhood stories.   
      3. Museo de Antioquia   
      4. Museo de Arte Moderno de Medellín   
      5. Go to Plaza Mayor and hire bikes and cycle along the river in Parques del río   
      6. Plaza Botero   
      7. Parque Arví (make sure you go on the cable cars there)  
      8. Go watch a football match (Viajero organises matchday visits)  
      9. Dance classes and socials at DanceFree  
      10. Botanical garden   
      11. Pueblito paisa   
      12. Comuna 13 tour   
          Please do it with Casa Kolacho (+573113473131 on whatsapp). They’re an arts foundation named after a young rapper that died during the violent period of the comuna. The guy who does the English tours (José) is such an incredible person. He was one of the first social workers to enter the comuna after operación orion and knows/is loved by everyone in the comuna. You won’t learn as much on a tour with anyone else. If you choose to do the tour in Spanish, there’s an equally wonderful person (I can’t remember their name) who is a trans rapper and street artist. The tour includes trying some food (there’s this frozen fruit thing that’s amazing) and at the end of the tour when you return to casa kolacho, you can learn how to do graffiti. The price for the tour is like 60-70K COP total and the money goes towards keeping the foundation alive.   
      13. Casa de la memoria   
          I personally loved this museum but apparently the English audio guide is terrible which is a massive shame. It’s an interactive museum/archive of the memories of the victims of various bouts of violence in the city over the years. Talking to other people, I think there’s a level of baseline knowledge you need to interact with artefacts in there (I’d suggest doing both the city tour and the comuna tour before going here). However, I think this museum is a billion times better than going to the Pablo Escobar museum and a lot more respectful.   
      14. Gutapé boat party  
          Viajero organises a guatapé boat party every Saturday and the ticket includes transport to and from, lunch at viajero gutapé, alcohol, boat party and pool party. You do get to climb peñol but you’ll have to pay out of your own pocket (it’s like 20K COP). I think how much fun you have at the party depends on who goes with you. We had an amazing time but I think a big part of that chalks up to the fact we knew half the people there (a friend went the week after and didn’t like it as much). Nonetheless 10/10 boat party.     
      15. Perro Negro (legendary nightclub that Bad Bunny wrote a song about)  
   3. What to eat  
      1. Alambique (Colombian)  
         This was probably my favourite restaurant experience in all of Colombia. All the recipes are created by the chefs and it’s mainly inspired by Colombian pacific cuisine. The interior was amazing and my rec would be to sit on the rooftop terrace. Definitely go in a group of 5 because it’s big enough to get the sharing plates but also you’ll be able to get a table.   
      2. Wokhouse (Japanese)  
      3. Vegan & Veggie Poblado (they do a 20k COP menú del día)  
      4. El altar taquería manila (best tacos ever)  
      5. Bao Bei (korean)  
      6. Aquí paró lucho (super nice locals spot that do the best paella in medellín).   
      7. Hija Mia (brunch)  
   4. Where to stay   
      Viajero \-   
      All the hostels are in the poblado area so I can imagine all the hostels in the area being similar. I like the design of the rooms and how social it is. A lot of people from other hostels came for the boat trip organised from Viajero so it definitely feels like it’s in the middle of things. They also have a nice rooftop bar.   
   5. Other tips  
      1. Pablo Escobar  
         I’m not going to get into the politics of this guy but everyone has a different recommendation on where to learn about him depending on their political views. There’s a bit of a family feud going on in the Escobar family so the museum and parcelación el monte are against each other. From what I could work out, both don’t depict Pablo Escobar and what happened in the most accurate light and definitely is a money grab for the family no matter which way you look at it. I think the most respectful way to learn about what happened is talking to tour guides and going to casa de la memoria. I don’t know what it’s called but if you ask a real city tour guide about a pablo escobar tour, they can recommend you a provider that does in a way that feels honest to the experience of people from the city (according to what Dio told me).    
      2. Travel card  
         Medellin is the only city in Colombia with a metro and you’ll need to buy a travel card to get around. You pay 10k COP to get the card and then you can top it up with whatever 50k COP should be more than enough for your stay. You can use one card for as many people you like so no need to buy multiple if you’re travelling in a group. The travel card is also valid when using the hire bikes as well.   
      3. Airport  
         Don’t call an uber, cabify, indrive etc.. taxi from the airport (to get there is more or less fine and you won’t get caught) because only official taxis have licences there. If the taxi driver gets caught they can lose their car and get a massive fine which isn’t fair to them.   
5. **Cartagena**   
   1. *How to get there from Medellín*    
      At this point we were tired of coaches and found a really cheap flight to Cartagena. It was £20 for each person with luggage included so it was a no-brainer. Jetsmart and wingo do the cheapest deals and you should be fine book 2-3 days ahead of your chosen travel day.  
   2. What to do/see  
      1. Walk around Getsamani   
      2. Plaza santo domingo (there’s traditional performances at night during the weekend)  
      3. Cafe havana (salsa bar)  
      4. Museo de Cartagena de las indias   
      5. Volcán de lodo el totumo   
      6. Do a bar crawl (the clock pub has a good view of the tower on the rooftop terrace)  
      7. Isla Barú   
      8. Snorkelling tour   
      9. Playa Blanca   
   3. What to eat  
      1. La Cevichería   
         This place was recommended by Anthony Bourdain and I went there for my birthday. It’s definitely some of the best seafood I had in Colombia and it’s definitely worth the price.   
   4. Where to stay   
      1. Viajero   
         Nothing super out there so if you get a recommendation to go elsewhere I’d do that. Our room was right next to the bar which was a BALL ACHE which I think is a big reason why I wasn’t a big fan. Other than that the hostel is nice, in a good location and the staff are super lovely and helpful.   
   5. Other tips  
      1. All the hostels are in the old city centre and it’s definitely not a safe city beyond those walls. That being said, I’ve never felt so harassed and so overstimulated in other places in Colombia. On quite literally every street there is someone trying to sell you a tour and there are so many men who catcall. This also happens on beaches and you quite literally can’t go 5 mins without someone selling something to you. Also beware of the women who start massaging you out of nowhere which is a common tourist trap. If you could go with a Colombian to the beach and stay mute, that’s your best chance to not get overcharged.   
      2. Everything is so much more expensive in Cartagena. The gringo tax is especially extortionate, which is mainly because there are SO MANY American family tourists in the city and everything is catered to them.   
      3. Cartagena is also the city where I felt most uncomfortable with the wealth disparity. There are a lot of Venezuelan refugees begging on the street and people are next level blasé (e.g. stepping over people sleeping on the street, shouting at women ‘maybe you shouldn’t have had children’ when they’re begging for someone to buy diapers) about it which I found really difficult to accept.   
      4. The beaches in the city are nowhere near as nice as the ones just outside it. Unfortunately those beaches have no phone signal so the best way of visiting is going via a tour provider or organising with a local taxi driver to pick you up at a certain time.   
      5. Only book with accredited tour guides and to make things easier, just book directly through your hostel (we did this for snorkelling). A full day tour should never be more than €40 pp and it should include travel to and from, the activities, beach time and a meal.   
      6. Cartagena is uncomfortably hot because of the humidity. Prepare to sweat 24/7 and make sure where you stay has really strong air conditioning. The temperature does not drop at night at all so be prepared to constantly shower.   
6. **Tayrona**   
   1. *How to get there from Cartagena*   
      We took a bus to Santa Marta and from there a taxi to Mamatoco and another bus to Buritaca (where our hostel was). The journey was about 7-ish hours in total.  
   2. *What to do/see*  
      1. Tayrona Park  
         How to enter: Entrada Zaino is the most convenient for most people and you pay for entry and insurance there (around 70K COP). Right next to it is a mini van service that takes you to the start of the hike which I highly recommend (5k COP). Only thing to note is that their last service down to the entrance is like 4pm.   
         1. Stay overnight at Cabo San Juan/Playa Brava  
            Hammocks are like 40k COP and you get to see the sunrise  
         2. Do day hikes to la piscina or la piscinita   
            We didn’t stay overnight but did day hikes to these two beaches which were super close by (2h and 20 mins respectively) to the entrance and probably the best beaches for swimming in that side of the park. Both beaches were super quiet and peaceful and there’s some ceviche stalls near la piscina which are 30k COP per bowl.   
      2. Lost city hike  
         We didn’t do this but it's a challenging 4 day hike (2 days to get there and two to get back) and you’re meant to do it with a company that takes care of literally everything. I think all lost city hikes start in Santa Marta (or you get picked up from there). Everyone that I met that did it, loved it but also it is very gruelling \- it’s definitely something I regret not doing.   
      3. Rio Hostel party   
         This is a must-do and happens a couple times during the week (the best one is on a saturday). The DJ lineup is always good and you can hang by the river next to the bonfire. To get there (if you’re not staying there) is by mototaxi which is around 30-40K COP depending what time of night. The party ends at 8pm but you can leave at any time as there’s a bunch of motor taxis waiting by the door to go at any moment. The bar is cashless so you need to pay 20K COP to hire a wristband and then top it up with cash which is non-refundable if you don’t use it all.   
   3. What to eat  
      1. Except for our packed lunches, we ate at the hostel the entire time. The food is lovely and they do a family dinner every night at 7pm (we weren’t major fans of what we had on the first night so we ate à la carte).    
   4. Where to stay  
      1. Journey Hostel  
         This was by far my favourite hostel of the trip. The pool is lovely and the views from the hostel into Tayrona are gorgeous. It’s v chill vibes but very sociable (everyone sits by the pool and there’s always an evening activity).  
      2. Any ecohostel in the area is pretty nice. Viajero Tayrona has a beach but apparently it isn’t great and Rio Hostel, although an amazing place to party at, if you stay there you’ll be condemned to party until 8am.   
   5. Other tips  
      1. You can get a 3k COP bus from the journey hostel to entrada zaino (3 min drive vs 20 min walk). It’s always a white, blue, green small bus (the same you take from Santa Marta to Buritaca).   
      2. Also there are no nearby cash machines so please stock up before heading there.  
7. **Palomino**   
   1. *How to get there from Tayrona*   
      We took the white, blue, green bus directly to Palomino which is around 20k COP ish. It was a touch over an hour to get there and then 20 min walk to the hostel.   
   2. *What to do/see*  
      1. Go to the beach  
      2. Tubing  
         It's 50k COP per person and the mototaxi picks you up from the reception. I recommend having a small waterproof bag for your shoes, spf and drinks (I went in flip flops, broke one when I stepped in mud and had to do the hike barefoot). The hike to the starting point is like 25 mins and you have to carry the tube on your head. There’s a guy at the halfway point selling beer at the cooler for reasonable prices but I’d suggest buying it in town before heading off (although it means you’ll be carrying it for longer hiking).    
   3. *What to eat*  
      1. Holss (vegan)  
      2. Grosso (argentinian empanadas)  
      3. There’s a Venezuelan arepa place down the road from Dreamer (like 3 mins away) but I can’t remember/find it again.   
   4. *Where to stay*   
      Dreamer Hostel  
      We stayed at Dreamer hostel which was lovely. They had a nice pool and were right next to the beach. The hostels in Palomino don’t differ too greatly but the general rule is to stay as close to the beach as possible because that means there’s more people. Granted it was low season, but I met someone who was staying at a hostel slightly further out where there were only 5 people there. You can book tubing at the reception and you’re usually pooled with other neighbouring hostels.  
   5. *Other tips*  
      1. I would say two days max is needed for palomino. There isn’t much nightlife but the river and beach are lovely.   
8. Minca  
   1. *How to get there from Palomino*  
      You have to take a bus to Santa Marta from Palomino and the bus terminus is in front of the ticket office for vans to Minca (which is in the city’s main market). It’s around 10k COP and you have to wait around until there are enough passengers to depart. It’s about a 45 min drive from Santa Marta to Minca.     
   2. What to do/see  
      1. Waterfalls and natural reserves  
         1. There’s this massive road that goes out from Minca and finishes on the other side of town. That entire road basically covers all the waterfalls and natural reserves that you would want to visit.  
         2. The loop is about 25km (you can’t do it in one day hiking) so you could spend multiple days hiking to different ones. An alternative is hiring a motorbike (or going with someone who knows how to ride) to see the sights. Day hire is 160k COP (so 80k COP per person) but only go for it if you’ve done dirt road biking or are with someone experienced. A big advantage about going by bike is that you get to see the waterfalls while they’re empty as everyone is still hiking up.   
      2. Cocoa farm  
         La candelaria farm is like an hour hike from Minca (you can take a mototaxi) and the tour is 30k COP. The tour guide was incredibly sweet and the views from the farm are gorgeous.   
      3. Casa Loma activities   
         Casa Loma runs daily yoga sessions, breathwork, indigenous jewellery making workshops as well as a weekly field-plate farm trip learning about biodiversity and food in Colombia. They, hands down. have the best viewpoint of the town and almost always have a sunset DJ session or open mic which is fun to go to even if you’re not staying there.   
   3. What to eat  
      1. Duni cafe (breakfast/brunch)  
      2. Taco y Chela (Mexican)  
      3. Amora (brunch)  
      4. Rio Elemento Hostel’s burgers  
      5. El costeño (get the bandeja paisa inspired bowl)  
      6. Casa Loma   
      7. Marhaba (Lebanese \- I didn’t like it but everyone else that I went with did)   
   4. Where to stay   
      1. Casa Loma  
         Casa Loma is breathtaking but you do have to hike up a mini mountain on a daily basis. The worst is when you first arrive because you’re carrying your backpack and have no idea of how long the walk up is. They have a really nice kitchen with really healthy veggie food and so many nice view points. The staff are super lovely and friendly.   
      2. Rio Elemento  
         Another option that is less uphill is Rio and the hostel has a pool and private bit of the river which is fun to swim in. I hung out there for an afternoon and they make amazing burgers there. I would say Casa Loma trumps Rio in terms of vibes.   
      3. A big tip with accommodation in Minca is to stay as close to the town as possible. There’s gorgeous hostels on the outskirts near the waterfalls (mundo nuevo) but that’s an incredibly disgusting hike to do with a 50L backpack on you.   
   5. Other tips  
      1. I think it’s not necessary to complete the entire loop and some of the natural reserves are just unkempt fields. I think hiking to oído del mundo and pozo azul on separate days are more than enough.

9. **Things I didn’t get to do but will be jealous of you if you did**   
* Sendero de las moyas (near Bogotá)  
* Iglesia de sal (near Bogotá)  
* Camino Real Barichara (Santander)  
* Santa Rosa thermals (a common next stop after Salento)  
* Buenaventura (if it’s whale season)  
* Bahia Malaga National park \- pacifico hostel (if you got to buenaventura)  
* San Gil (Santander)  
* Bucaramanga (Santander)  
* Santa Marta/Taganga (people said skip Santa Marta but it seems worth going to Taganga beach just on the outskirts, there’s also a really nice beach next to Santa Marta airport)  
* Chocó   
* Desierto de la tatacoa   
* San Bernardo   
* San Andres   
* San Blas island tour

10. **Miscellaneous tips**   
    1. Sim cards:   
       It’s definitely not worth it to get an e-sim for what it’s worth and the 3G/4G coverage is pretty shit even in cities. Your best bet is getting a pay-as-you-go Claro sim card, it’s the most popular and has the best coverage. I’ve met people who’ve used Tigo sim cards and they said it was shit and a big pro with Claro is that you can be in a tiny ass town and you can always find somewhere to recharge the sim card. 

       *How to set it up*   
       So while you can buy a pay-as-you-go sim card from any corner shop, you would save time buying it from an official Claro shop. I bought mine from the corner shop because we were told that you can buy a package through the Claro app or through their phone line \- lies lol, don’t waste 2 hours of your life like I did. 

       The reason why I say go directly to a Claro shop is that you can buy the sim card, add a package to it and also importantly ‘unlock’ the sim card all in one go. If you don’t visit an official Claro shop and register the phone number of the Claro sim card, it will deactivate itself in 1-2 weeks after purchase which is a waste of money. Basically, you want to sort out your phone in one go so you don’t have to think about it for the rest of the trip. After that point, if you need to recharge your sim card, you can go to any corner shop and it takes seconds. 

    2. Coaches/taxis/planes:  
       1. Coaches  
          When booking big journeys I always recommend booking online through redbus. They accept European cards unlike other providers and it makes things easier if you need to get a refund.   
       2. Taxis  
          1. The cheapest and fastest way to get around big cities alone is by mototaxi. I use uber or indrive to book my bikes and they always come with a helmet. If you’re two people or more, the cheapest option is a normal taxi.   
          2. The best taxi app in Colombia is InDrive. You set a price as the customer and you barter with the drivers and choose the best deal (there’s a guide price that I suggest you follow as a bare minimum).  
          3. Cabify is also a must have app for taxis in Colombia and it’s always cheaper than uber and less volatile in prices compared to indrive (although in drive tends to always be the cheapest).   
          4. Uber is kind of my last resort app but it is still very cheap \- a 30 min drive across Cali was like £1.50 but it definitely depends where you are.   
       3. Planes  
          Jetsmart and Wingo are your best bets for cheap flights between big cities. I would say it’s better to fly to the Caribbean coast than using the coach because I’ve heard it's especially uncomfortable but that could be a very individual experience. Coaches going to Medellin, Cali, Salento and Bogotá are absolutely fine. 

    3. Accommodation  
       1. The Viajero deal is a steal and carries over to other branches. All the viajeros are really high quality and I think sticking with a hostel chain was quite nice because it meant we did less planning and spent less money.   
       2. I do however, highly recommend staying at the non-viajero hostels I stayed at, especially journey hostel. From what I heard, journey was miles better than viajero tayrona. 

    4. What you definitely have to eat/drink:   
       1. Menu del día   
          At lunch, please look out for menú del día on signs outside restaurants. For around 20k COP, you can get a starter (usually soup), a main and a drink which is a steal.   
       2. Go to a fruit market and try different fruits  
          Colombia has so much biodiversity and you can see it in the produce. Buying a bunch of different fruit and trying it with friends is a lot of fun.  
       3. Alcohol  
          You need to try chicha, aguardiente, viche curao and any beer with michelada (a salt and/or tajín rim and lime juice)  
       4. Colombian classics  
          Try arepa con queso (usually at a street stall found in any city), empanadas, tamales tolimenses, bandeja paisa, arroz con leche, hot chocolate with cheese, patacones con hogao, limonada de coco, coconut rice, ajiaco, sancocho, aborrajado, chicharrón. 

    5. What to watch/read/listen:   
       \- Monos (about guerrillas who didn’t agree with what they were forced to do)  
       \- Pájaros de verano (about wayú tribe and weed trafficking in guajira)  
       \- Colores de la montaña (about the landmines issue due to paramilitary/guerrilla conflict).  
       \- Gabriel García Marquez books \- I recommend Crónica de una muerte anunciada to start with but the most famous is Cien años de Soledad (there’s a new netflix show coming out in December). I also recommend El amor en los tiempos del cólera (this has been made into a film)   
       \- Laura Restrepo’s book ‘El Leopardo al Sol’ is a great short read and based loosely on real events related to the drug trade.   
       \- Mi marcha: historias de las movilizaciones lgbti+ en Bogotá: 40 años de la marcha de la ciudadanía lgbt by Cristina Rojas Tello  
       \- ¡Basta Ya\! Memorias de guerra y dignidad ([Colombian national version](https://www.jep.gov.co/Sala-de-Prensa/Documents/basta-ya-memorias-guerra-dignidad-new-9-agosto.pdf)) ([Medellín specific](https://acimedellin.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/medellin-memorias-de-una-guerra-urbana-baja.pdf)). Both are books that give you encyclopaedic knowledge about the politics, dynamics and history that has shaped Colombia. I think it works well as a great reference point if you have a specific question that you feel like is unanswered.   
       \- Explore la comisión de la verdad website ([here](https://www.comisiondelaverdad.co/)). They have illustrations and a wealth of content that unpicks Colombia’s history (a lot of the art and interactive pages are available in English, French and German).   
       \- Misión Gaia’s beginners Spanish playlist [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0gwxdrrpU5oCpzhbrpST8U?si=f1a5d4dec85048d7)  
       \- Georgie’s Colombia playlist (not Colombian at all but it’s what we had on repeat lol)  [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3vDfhJg9W7jTeaOg67M2LG?si=24d2c6877b094607)
