# Back-chaining

Start with what you want the conclusion to be, and then follow backwards actions that will lead to that conclusion

- Prerequisite- Goals
    - What are your most fundamental values?
- Humans are not automatically strategic (Forum Post) For example, nobody ever looks up how to study best despite it being incredibly important.
- Time and money are fungible: always try to compare opportunity cost as a factor of time and money.
- If something takes less than 2 minutes, do it immediately
- If you have an issue set an arbitrary time limit to focus all energy on it (Maybe 5 min)

# Red Teaming

1. Make a plan for a goal you have
2. Imagine the deadline has passed and you failed to achieve that goal
3. Rate how surprised you are that your plan didnt work
4. Improve and/or change your plan
    - Do things with others
    - Penalties with external accountability
    - Rewards
    - Concrete time to do an action
    - Track and Stack functioning techniques
5. Repeat 2-4 until youd be sufficiently surprised your plan didnt work
