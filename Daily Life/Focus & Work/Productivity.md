- The 2-Day Rule: Never miss the same habit two days in a row. This simple rule has been more effective than any complex tracking system.
- Decision Minimization: I prep my workspace, clothes, and meals the night before. Eliminating these small decisions preserves mental energy for important work.
- The 5-Minute Start: I commit to just 5 minutes of any difficult task. 90% of the time, I continue past 5 minutes once friction is overcome.
- Trigger Stacking: I attach new habits to existing behaviors (e.g., stretching during coffee brewing, reading while on exercise bike).
- Weekly Course Correction: Sunday evenings are sacred for reviewing what worked/didn't and adjusting for the coming week.
