Our brain, weirdly enough, does not discriminate between completed tasks and tasks that we are certain we wont forget about in the future. This is why its important, when you think of something to do later, no matter how small, to instantly write it down so that thing doesnt take up any extra brain space. This is also why its important to have a central note taking hub such as todoist to be sure that things are at least noted for the future. This is called the "Zeigarnik Effect"
