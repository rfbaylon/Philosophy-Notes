What is College For?

See Deresiewicz
The first purpose of college is to liberate students from what [[Plato]] called *doxa*, or, immediate, shallow, and brute opinions. 
	Excellent Sheep, 80

The goal of college is to build a self
"Weve taught [todays young people] that a self is something you just *have*"
	[[Foster Wallace]], Cited in Excellent Sheep, 83

"It's been said that people go to monasteries to find out why they have come, and college ought to be the same."
	Excellent Sheep, 86

"The purpose of college is to make you a more interesting person..."
	Hacker and Dreifus, Cited in Excellent Sheep, 83

"Interesting is not accomplished. Interesting is not impressive. What does make you interesting is reading, thinking, slowing down, having long conversations, and creating a rich inner life for yourself"
	Excellent Sheep, 83-84

"If I wished a boy to know something about the arts and sciences, for instance, I would not pursue the common course, which is merely to send him to the neighborhood of some professor, where anything is professed and practiced but the art of life; - to survey the world through a telescope or a microscope,m and never with his natural eye; to study chemistry, and not learn how his bread is made, or mechanics and not learn how it s earned; to discover new satellites to Neptune and not detect the motes in his eyes, to to what vagabond he is a satellite himself; or to be devoured by the monsters that swarm all around him, while contemplating the monsters in a drop of vinegar. Which would be most advanced in a month -- the boy who had made his own jackknife from the ore which he had dug and smelted, reading as much as would be necessary for this, -- or the boy who had attended the lectures on metallurgy at the Institute in the meanwhile, and had received a Rogers' penknife from his father? Which would be most likely to cut his fingers? To my astonishment, I was informed on leaving college that I had studied Navigation! -- why, if I had taken one turn down the harbour I should have known more about it."
	[[Walden]] 45-46
