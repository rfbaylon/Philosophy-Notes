# Philosophy-Notes
This is a constantly-publishing datafile of every note I have taken in philosophy for the past few years. Im still filling out a lot of the details, formatting, and actual data, so check back frequently if a certain subject hasnt been filled out yet. These notes can be viewed in either Obsidian or Notion as .md's

Please feel free to take any information and make it your own! Knowledge should be free and open to everybody.
