# About
**Running since July 26, 2022**

This is a git containing most notes I've taken for the past few years. I'm still filling out a lot of the details, formatting, and actual information. In fact, this will likely never be complete.

Especially lately, I have been of the opinion that it doesn't count as a thought unless its written down. If that is true, this vault is the medium of thought, which just makes it a quite literal second brain of mine. 

As of 2025, I am pausing the project. As this application has come to touch every facet of my knowledge storage and production, I cannot justify making everything public all the time. That which is accessible will mostly just be book notes and philosophy notes, and published blog posts (though perhaps even those are rather personal). I might update it every so often with book notes or other thoughts, but going forward that will become more rare. I do still value "showing my work" as it could help others, which is why much of it is still up. 

If you have any comments or questions, please email me at rfbaylon@gmail.com, I love hearing from people!

These notes can be read in any markdown editor or unformatted in any regular text editor.
