# Philosophy-Notes
**Running since July 26, 2022**

This is a git containing every single note Ive taken for the past few years. I'm still filling out a lot of the details, formatting, and actual information, so check back frequently if a certain subject hasn't been filled out yet. These notes can be viewed in either Obsidian, Notion or just plain text editors as .md's.

Please feel free to take any information and make it your own! Knowledge should be free and open to everybody.

## What Are Tags?

#Cite - Citation needed
#WIP - Something that needs an (at most) 20 minute fix
#Update - Large projects that I learned recently that need a note
#Questions - Tangential questions that arise that I don't yet have an answer to.
#MyArgument - An argument that I came up with myself. If something with this tag mirrors an already existing argument or idea, it is purely by coincidence.
#Quote - Cool quotes that could come in handy. This does not apply to all quotes as some are incredibly narrow.
#MyStance - Currently I am trying to write down my positive position among all of the arguments I find
#blog - Blog posts I write that can be found on my webstite ([ryanbaylon.neocities.org](ryanbaylon.neocities.org))
