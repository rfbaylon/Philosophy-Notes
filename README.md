# About
**Running since July 26, 2022**

This is a git containing most notes I've taken for the past few years. I'm still filling out a lot of the details, formatting, and actual information. In fact, this will likely never be complete.

As of 2025, I am now starting to keep pretty much all information from my personal life in this vault, so the selection on Github is just what I have explicitly made available. That which is accessible will mostly just be book notes and philosophy notes, and published blog posts (though perhaps even those are rather personal). In essence, this vault is an unedited autobiography of ideas I've taken seriously through the years. To me though, it is far more important to "show my work" as it could help others. 

Especially lately, I have been of the opinion that it doesn't count as a thought unless its written down. If that is true, this vault is the medium of thought, which just makes it a quite literal second brain of mine. 

If you have any comments or questions, please email me at rfbaylon@gmail.com, I love hearing from people!

These notes can be read in any markdown editor or unformatted in any regular text editor.
