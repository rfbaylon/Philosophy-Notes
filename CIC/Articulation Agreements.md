Guiding Research questions:
- It seems controversial if AAs increase transfer rates (See Payne et al., 2022, p575 for sources). Do they? If not, what does this mean for AAs as a policy prescription?
## State Support
31 states require a guaranteed transfer of an associates degree to a BA
25 states have reverse transfer (turning a partial bachelors into a full associates) embedded in legislation

## Benefits

### Cost
Tuition of community colleges are, on average, 1/3 the cost of four year schools 

One study found that at least two thirds of credits must be transferable to recognize savings, and there are substantial cost savings if students were able to transfer all of their community college credit (Belfield et al. 2017)

Payne et al., 2017 found a 16.5k cost reduction through making an AA.
### Career Mobility
AAs can get students into better paying careers more quickly
Students are also able to work in a technical position after their associates while getting their bachelor's
### SES Mobility
"Half of all Hispanic students who earn bachelor's degrees start at a community college, and in the US, 43% of community college students are non-white and 42% are the first in their families to attend college" (Lyon & Denner, 2016, p5).

Easier transfers = More low SES students graduating with bachelors

### Synergism / Gestalt
Limitations of one higher education institution can be offset by the strengths of another (Fincher et al., 2017)
### Flexibility
(need data)

## Obstacles

### Curricular Issues
There is tendency among university faculty to question the quality of community college courses (Mosholder & Zirkle, 2007, p143). This is especially true for STEM fields who have more linear curricula.

Additionally, an associates degree is more geared towards industry and practicality, which dont easily merge with bachelor's degrees. (Cooper et al., 2009)

Interdisciplinary majors require much more faculty buy in and support for a good AA.
### Communication Issues
Lots of AAs are unadvertised, hidden in college websites, and vague.
There is a lot of extra work that goes intro transferring, and the less students need to work to discover important information, the more transfers to 4y universities will happen.

Even "articulation agreement" is a clunky phrase that doesn't mean anything to the average person. 
### CS Specific
Math Requirements will become harder and have less


## Best Practice

Payne et al., 2017 (p581) found 7 areas of success for implementing an AA in cyber-security specifically.
1. Clear communication
2. Garuntees to students
3. Designated physical space
4. Well designed virtual space
5. shared hosting for meeting space for AA development
6. Accuracy
7. Simplicity
The authors additionally recommend (p585)
- Creating a culture of respect for transfer students
- Data collection and analysis for success rates
- Flexibility in development
