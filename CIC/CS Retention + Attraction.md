# Women

The top reasons women were interested in studying CS was because they were interested in it, to increase earning potential, because they thought they would be good at it, and because they liked challenging problems (Denner, Werner, & O'Connor, 2015, pg163). Computing for social good was really low (pace Eccles, 2006). Marketing at the community college level needs to hit these points.

Computer gaming (among other for-fun computer usage) in high school is also fairly highly correlated with continuing through community college to get a 4 year degree. (Denner, Werner, & O'Connor, 2015, pg164)

"Females report significantly less encouragement from their peers to persist in computer science, and they also report spending less time playing computer games. These findings are particularly problematic becuase peer encouragement and compuiter gaming were two of the strongest predictors of intention to major in CIS" (Denner et al., 2015, p354).
