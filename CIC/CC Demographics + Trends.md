# General Stats

Almost 60% of students enrolled in CS classes were intending to transfer to a 4-year university and major in CS or CE (Lyon & Denner, 2016, p7)

"In general, the data suggest that navigating the pathway to a CS bachelor's degree is most complex and challenging, followed by navigating the pathway to other types of STEM bachelor's degrees" (Fink, Fletcher, Dundar, 2016, p13)

Mass Community Colleges serve more low income people than ever: 45% in 2014 vs 21% in 2005.

While 81 percent begin with the intention to earn a bachelor’s degree, only 33  percent actually transfer up to a four-year institution within six years, and just 14 percent complete a bachelor’s degree 
	(Jenkins and Fink 2016).

Among the bachelor’s degrees awarded in computer and information science in 2013–2014, only 18% were awarded to women, 11% to Black students, and 9% to Hispanic students (Snyder, de Brey, & Dillow, 2015, Table 318.30).

Amount of CS degrees awarded has more than doubled since 2014

# Gender
Among the bachelor’s degrees awarded in computer and information science in 2013–2014, only 18% were awarded to women, 11% to Black students, and 9% to Hispanic students 
	(Snyder, de Brey, & Dillow, 2015, Table 318.30).

the more diverse environment of the community college may help them feel more welcome in fields traditionally dominated by White men (Jackson & Laanan, 2011; Lyon & Denner, 2016; Starobin & Laanan, 2008).

"In fact over half of women who earn a STEM degree started out at a community college and 43% of people who earned a degree in computer or mathematical sciences in 2010 attended a community college" (Lyon & Denner, 2016, p5)

"Among the students who earned a CS pre-baccalaureate award, those who never transferred seemed to be older and lower income than those who earned some type of bachelor's within the timeframe under study. Compared with their peers who earned a CS bachelors' degree, they were twice as likely to be female. While they were similarly likely to attend a community college that had an occupational (vs transfer) focus, their colleges had weaker transfer performance metrics" (Fink, Fletcher, Dundar, 2016)

77% of people who graduated with a CS degree in 2022 were men

Women in STEM find the community college environment far more satisfying and supportive
	Jackson et al. 2011

Two thirds of women in CC come from two lowest income categories, one third are first gen, almost all of worked, over three quarters aimed to transfer

# Race + Ethnicity

Transfer Out Rate:
- White: 39%
- Hispanic: 27%
- Black: 35%
- Low Income: 25%
- 25+: 22%



"Half of all Hispanic students who earn bachelor's degrees start at a community college, and in the US, 43% of community college students are non-white and 42% are the first in their families to attend college" (Lyon & Denner, 2016, p5).

"Community colleges are an untapped resource for increasing diversity in CS, with 57% of Hispanic and 52% of Black undergraduates educated at community colleges" (Lyon & Denner, 2016, p3)

35% of people who graduated with a CS degree in 2022 were white
20% were Asian
9% were hispanic
4% were african american
2% are hispanic women
1.3% are african american women
	https://datausa.io/profile/cip/computer-science-110701#employment

Among those who transferred from a two-year institution, Asian and White students were more likely to transfer to four-year institutions (49.8 percent and 50.4 percent, respectively) than Black and Hispanic students (33.2 percent and 39.5 percent, respectively).

Among students whos primary goal was transfer, 31% poc transferred compared to 46% of white students. 55% of poc students earned a bachelors compared with 64% of white students.
