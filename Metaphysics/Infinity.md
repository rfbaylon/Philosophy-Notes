Actual vs Potential Infinity:
Actual Infinity: An actually existing infinite set
Potential Infinity: A set of things approaching infinity (1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ...)



## The Absurdity of Infinity
### [[Hilbert]]'s Hotel
A hotel has ∞ rooms for ∞ guests numbered after all of the natural numbers.
One person comes to the front and asks for a room, and the concierge says that if we move the person in room 1 to room 2, the person in room 2 to room 3, etc., etc., we can fit this new person.
We still end up with ∞ guests.
Thus ∞ + 1 = ∞

After this, ∞ people show up and ask for ∞ rooms. The concierge says this is possible, but they will have to move the person in room 1 to room 2, room 2 to room 4, room 3 to room 6, etc., etc.
We still end up with ∞ guests.
Thus ∞ + ∞ = ∞

The manager gets upset the rooms are too loud, and asks all of the people who just arrived to leave, and for everyone to move to their original room.
Everyone does, and we still end up with ∞ guests.
Thus ∞ - ∞ = ∞

The manager wants to shut down the hotel, so he asks everyone to leave except for 4 people. Everyone obliges except for the people in rooms 1, 2, 3, and 4.
∞ guests left, but there are still 4 rooms occupied.
Thus ∞ - ∞ = 4
