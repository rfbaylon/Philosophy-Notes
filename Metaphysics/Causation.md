[[My Stance]] on Causation: Hume is right that as humans right now, the only thing we can gather is correlational data. As of now, I am causally agnostic as I dont know if it can be proven that necessary truths on causation can be proven, and the burden of proof lies on the causal realist. I lean towards necessitarianism (alongside Spinoza) but I need to look more into it.

From [[Mumford+Anjum]] (date)
[[Causation A Very Short Introduction]]
### Causal Eliminativism
See [[Russell]], [[Hume]]
Causation is nonexistent; all we see are succession/ correlation NOT causes
	[[Russell]]: If causes are anterior to effects then there is an asymmetry between causes and effects which is found nowhere else in physics. Therefore, we ought not hold a double standard for causation.
	Math: A <-> B  Causation: A-> B
		A2: Certain variables in mathematics are absolutely asymmetrical
		A2: This is outdated. Since Russell, we have discovered the one way flow of entropy: everything moves to chaos and not the other way
		A2: Statements about physics come after, NOT BEFORE, philosophy
			Related to [[Quine]] [[Indispensability Argument]] ([[Mathematical Platonism]])
	[[Hume]]: As a fan of empericism (See [[Rationalism, Empiricism, & Idealism]]), Hume claims that the only thing we can learn from the world is that one thing tends to follow another thing. We have NO evidence of causal connection between A and B, only a repeated correlation. "It would not be contrary to reason that the sun wont rise tomorrow."
		A2: The thing that would disprove this are the existences of necessary laws of the universe.
		A2: Does Hume have too high of an epistemic standard?
		A2: what is the causal difference between betting on a really good horse and winning vs wearing a lucky tie to the racing tracks? To Hume, these have to be the same.
		A2: If something 'causes' something once, that is not enough to say that it caused it. It could be a freak accident. Hume bit this bullet

### Causal Necessitarianism
See [[Spinoza]]
When event A happens, event B *necessarily* happens after.
	Causes are *genuinley productive.* (anti [[Hume]]) Event A leads to event B in all possible worlds
	[[Spinoza]]: From a given definite cause, an effect necessarily follows (Ethics I, Axiom III) [[Spinoza's Proof of God (Simple)]]
		Doesnt this have to be true as a cause *presupposes* an effect
	"beheading necessarily leads to death in situation X"
	An effect: Even if mind is independent of body, the body is still subject to all material causation; no Libertarian Freewill is gained. Humeanism doesnt solve either; in his case, the body is subject to randomness rather than causation (See [[Free Will & Determinism]])
		A2: Hume: how can you find rational necessity within physical things?


### Counterfactualism
Causation is counterfactual dependence between events.
	Keep in mind this creates a negative definition, and can rely on modal realism or antirealism (see [[Modality]])
	Ex. we test causation within medicine all the time with counterfactuals: would the supposed effect of a medication have happened without any medication at all?
		A2: counterfctuals exist because of causation, counterfactualism isnt what makes a cause, it is the side effect. Counterfactualism is a more complicated necessitarianism
		A2: there are counterfactuals that, while being true, ignore causes (Ex: an elk on a railway may have been the cause of the trains delay, but there was a broken signal later down the line that would have made the train late either way)

### Physicalism
(related to [[materialism]]): Causation is energy transfer
	Physicists should be the ones telling us what causes are, not philosophers!
	Physicalism is symmetrical: effects gain energy, causes lose it (A2 [[Russell]]). Both cause and effect happen at the same time, ditching temproal priority
		A2: This also means that EVERYTHING EVER is caused by energy transfer, which dualists will disagree with

### Pluralism
Causation is theory A, B, C, D, OR E depending on the context (See [[Wittgenstein]]). There is no one essence of 'causation' and to look for it is a mistake. 
	Ex. Even though there is no one essence to every member of a family, there can be characteristics each of them share that make them generally alike
		A2: resemblance includes impostors that arent actual members of the group
		A2: Definition A and definition B (e.g.) are mutually exclusive definitions; they contradict one another.

### Primitivism
Causation is the most basic thing in the universe, its impossible to understand.
	Preception, knowledge and truth are all dependent upon causation.
	There has to be some primitive thing, why not causation
		A2: Why?
	We have direct understanding of causation
		A2: [[Hume]]: the only thing we know, even as causal patients, is correlation. We cant have direct experience of causation
		A2: isnt being more fundamental than causation? isnt causation predicated upon being?


### Dispositionalism
Things have dispositions to behave in certain conditions, and two things with meeting dispositions will create a new thing.
	Sugar has the disposition to dissolve in water, water has the disposition to dissolve sugar. Thus, when the two meet, both of the dispositions are fulfilled.
	(See [[Aristotle]])
		A2: Absences of things can be causes in themself (absence of water -> dehydration)
			A2A2: Couldn't a [[Hume]]an metaphysics account for this by which vacuums dont exist? 
		A2: this seems like a reformulated necessitarianism

### Constructivism
See [[Kant]]
Causation is an a priori filter within the understanding that our judgement imposes upon objects.
	Because conditional statements are a priori (If -> Then) there is a notion of cause within the understanding.
	Causation is a judgement of experience that holds objective validity as it appears to all understandings universally (See [[What is Discovery]]
	([[Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics]], 59)

### Ji-ji-mu-ge
See [[Zen Buddhism]]
If we take the idea that there is no distinction between all things seriously, it is hard to say that one object causes another as every thing is equally dependent. Ji-ji-mu-ge specifically applied to causation is called the principle of mutual arising - the idea that all occurances mutually occur. See [[Zen Buddhism]] for a more in depth exploration of this concept.
