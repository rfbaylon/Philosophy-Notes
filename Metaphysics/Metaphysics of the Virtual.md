## Virtual Realism

### Argument from [[The Simulation Hypothesis]]
See [[Chalmers]], [[Descartes]], [[Bostrom]]
It is the case that we could be simulated currently. Even if this were true, it would not follow that what we do is not real. It would just be a different kind of real than in the simulation above. The same would be true of a simulation below us: objects are just as existent, just one type of object would be made from atoms and the other would be made of bits.

## A2 Virtual Realism

# Fiction Theory

Everything that happens in the virtual world is a sort of fiction. The objects in the virtual world dont *actually* exist.
