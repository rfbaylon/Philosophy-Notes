### Conditions for the Mind
See [[Clark]], [[Chalmers]]
1. Consistency in the subject’s life
2. Directly available to the subject without difficulty
3. Automatic endorsement from subject
4. Conscious endorsement from subject
All of these bullets seem like reasonable conditions for  cognition, and it would provide a lot of utility to the word 'mind' to include these necessary and sufficient conditions.

### Argument from Explosion
It seems like knowledge in Wikipedia or Google Maps fits the above criteria for it being part of the cognitive process. Applying Wikipedia to the 4 criteria listed above to an average person’s day-to-day life, it is consistently used (1), directly available on someone's cell phone that they have everywhere they go (2), instantly accepted for certain matters like the date of the Battle of Hastings or the length of The Matrix (3), and consciously endorsed by its readers (4)
