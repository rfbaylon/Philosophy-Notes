What impact, if any, do reason and emotion have on our decision making?

### [[Plato]]'s Account
See [[Value Theory]] for why to care
Stump reconstruction --  The tripartite soul 
1. *The principle of opposites*: "it is obvious that the same thing will not be willing to do or undergo opposites in the same part of itself, in relation to the same thing, at the same time" ([[The Republic]], 4.436b).
2. *Identify the motions of the soul*: "Assent and dissent, wanting to have something and rejecting it, taking something and pushing it away" ([[The Republic]], 4.437b).
3. *Observe psychic conflict*: "... the soul of a thirsty person... wants to drink and is impelled towards it... Therefore, if something draws it back when it is thirsting, wouldn't that be something different in it from whatever thirsts...? It can't be, we say, that the same thing, with the same part of itself, in relation to the same, at the same time, does opposite things" ([[The Republic]], 4.439d).
4. *Designate these two parts*: "We'll call the aprt of the soul with which it calculates the *rational part* and the part with which it lusts, hungers, thirsts, and gets excitesd by the other appetites the irrational *appetitive part*" ([[The Republic]], 4.439d).
5. *Observe the third part*: "... when appetite forces someone contrary to rational calculation, he reproaches himself and gets angry with that in him that's doing the forcing, so that the two factions that are fighting a civil war... *spirit* allies itself with reason ([[The Republic]], 4.440a-b).

### Aristotle's Account
See [[Aristotle]]
There are three factors that make for choice and three that make for avoidance:  the fine, advantageous (prudential), and the pleasant, and their contraries, the base, the harmful, and the painful.
	[[Nichomachean Ethics]] 1104b200-1105a9
## A2 Classical Reason

### Reason is Socially Dependent
See [[Murdoch]]
Words in propositional phrases do not in themselves contain wisdom or teach. Words in specific contexts, times, and situations do. Reason does not function apart from an environment, but rather is embedded inside the social context
	[[Sovereignty of Good]], loc 648
	This links to [[Murdoch]]'s moral theory in [[Ethics of Attention]].

"Philosophy is often a matter of finding a suitable context to say the obvious"
	[[Sovereignty of Good]], loc 672
