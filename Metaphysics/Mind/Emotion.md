# What are Emotions?

# Experiential Colors
Emotion is baked into experience -- there are no individual things called emotions, but rather they are colorations, organizations of energy, within experience. "emotions are attached to events and objects in their moment" "Emotion is the moving and cementing force. It selects what is congruous and dyes what is selected with its color, thereby giving qualitative unitu to materials externally disparate and dissimilar."

There is no sense of perception *plus* emotion. Perceived objects are emotionally laden.
