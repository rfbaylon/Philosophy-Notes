### Empericist Bias
See Berent

Laypeople have a bias toward a tabula rasa epistemology
Science shows that newborns perfer good syllables (blig > lbog), keep track of time, have a concept of a person, fear of danger, love for ones family, lifting. When studying laypeople, there is a bais towards thinking that children do not bave these things. Science shows the opposite.

#### Why is there this bias?
Maybe:
- innocent ignorance
- Instinct Blindness
- Mindreading Blindness
- Social Concerns
None of these consider why they have a bias towards numbers!

See Berent:
Lay belief in dualism (minds are distinct from the material body) is high.
Essentialism, the belief that all
	Both dualism and essentialism arise from innate knowledge, creating the bias!

Dualism creates this bias as the body intuitively seems like an object to be manipulated. 

People who have a weaker theory of mind (autistic people) have a bias against dualism. 

Im curious about the link between dualism and empericism. Is your claim that beliefs in innate knowledge and dualism are mutually exclusive? If so, could you reiterate why that is?
