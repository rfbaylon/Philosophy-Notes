### Brief Summary
This paper discusses the history of the human nature dichotomy, first starting with a lot of the Christian and platonic ideas that lead people to search for a true reality beneath all of the trickery of nature and the human mind. the paper then develops into the replacement of "nature" with "environment" (a word with [[Process]] and human interaction built into it), and then explores many of the ideas about a postmodernist lens on what exactly the presuppositions of [['Progress']] and Dualism fail.
