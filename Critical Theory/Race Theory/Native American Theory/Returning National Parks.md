### Returning National Parks Helps National Parks
Since Native Americans have been properly managing ecosystems for thousands of years to the betterment of said ecosystems, it stands to reason that the currently underfunded national parks will be ecologically bolstered by the Native Americans who would return. One study found that Indigenous lands were richer in biodiversity than protected areas, such as national parks. It would be a better solution for humans and nonhumans alike.

### Returning National Parks Rectifies Past Injustices
Because national parks have been stolen from Native Americans in years past, the most appropriate way to repent is through returning it to tribes that originally owned them. The only way to heal the racial tension between descendants of settlers and Native Americans is to return the land to which Natives belong. Especially due to Muirs original ignorance of Indignous life, we need to recognize and change the harmful policies in order to heal the nation. This will be better not only for the tribes which are prevented from hunting and fishing on their lands, but for the benefit of the oppressors who gave it back. As Ibram X Kendi says in line with this, “Racism deforms the racist as well as the victim.”

### Loss of Culture
National parks have incredible cultural importance to Native Americans, and by stripping their power to manage national parks, you strip away an essential part of Native American culture. By preventing people from hunting, fishing, and practicing cultural traditions on their land is a continual act of cultural erasure. As a Director of the Interpretive Center, Delphine Baker told David Truer, “If you lose your culture, you lose your sovereignty and your tribe … And that’s what we’re fighting against.” By not including diverse voices, the NPS also adversely affects Natives by not taking into consideration their interests and practice

### Do Native Americans Want Parks Back?
It can be the case that popular academics want national parks back, but there are substantial questions as to whether or not tribes want the responsibility of managing national parks. It would be interesting to see polling data from tribes to see not only who wants the responsibility back, but how much they want it back. It would also be important to ask each tribe individually as Native Americans are not homogenous. What is the polling data from tribes about accepting this responsibility?

### Middle Ground
In order for this argument to succeed, there needs to be something uniquely good about returning the parks over reforming the way parks are run. Rather than fighting the status quo, the above argument also needs to explain why it is better than National Parks working with Native Americans who want to work with it, employ Indigenous knowledge, and to use more funds to help tribes.

### Lack of Planning (Sovereignty)
Although returning national parks is an incredibly just idea in theory, there are considerable questions about how it is implemented in practice. One major concern surrounds the amount of sovereignty that tribes will have. If tribes have a lot of sovereignty, then they could theoretically destroy some parts of a park for profit (including the Statue of Liberty), hunt or fish whenever and wherever they wish, or block off tourists entirely if they so decide. If they have restrictions, it seems to ruin the point of giving national parks back to Native Americans. If the USFG is still looking over the shoulder of tribes, then they are no longer sovereign nor truly manage the park.

### Lack of Planning (Funding)
There is also uncertainty concerning funding. If the USFG stops funding parks, who will? In his The Atlantic article, Truer mentions that the USF, in his ideal plan, will continue to provide some funding, but this will not cover for the already underfunded national parks that exist. If it is the case that there is a funding issue, then it seems like tribes will either have to raise prices (thus excluding some visitors), or resort to more extreme measures. There are also intersections between this problem and the previous. In his article Maybe Handing Over America’s National Parks Is a Bad Idea, Berger argues that tribes will have the legal ability to shut down parks for political power and money to accrue more funding. It could also be the case that some of the land could be sold to private industries to develop or log some of the land for profit to make up for the lack of funding from the USFG (as they can already do with tribal lands).

### Lack of Democratic Ownership
If the USFG owns the national parks, it implies every taxpayer has equal ownership of public land (as each voter is in as much control of the government as every other; each person owns it equally). National parks are specifically designed such that they are by nature communally owned; no one person has any more right to it than another. By returning parks to tribes, you explicitly claim that these parks are not the peoples, but rather belong to a small sect of people. This, like the previous point, also connects to the first point of sovereignty. It could easily be the case such that Natives block park access for tribal gain, showing an overt display of ‘right to own’ over someone else who could have a closer connection to the park, but not be a tribe member. IBeyond that, the argument can be made that a taxpayer who funds a park (per Truer’s plan) has a right to access they fund to upkeep.
