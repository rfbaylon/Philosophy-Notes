"That we dont think about such rejections of disability -- that we expect them, and even reward them -- shows just how deeply our understanding of disability is normativized. Imagine if Madeline Albright, upon being asked what it was like to be the first woman to be Secretary of State, had answered 'Well, I dont think of myself as a woman -- Ive always been determined to overcome my gender"... Wed be surprised at such statements to say the least. But its exactly what we *expect* from successful, barrier-breaking disabled people"

### Art as Voice

## Potential Issues

### Disabled art as Segregation
Creating a movement specifically for disabled artists otherizes disabled people. This also means that the message will be restricted just to disabled and allied audiences.
### Freakshows
Also called the "Freak Factor"
Whether or not its what disabled people want, audiences will still attend for something like a freakshow. Thsi audience would harm the disability movement. 

### Pity
Also called the "Supercripple effect"
Sensationalizing the disability of those on stage (either as a token pick, making it here “despite” their disability, or as a “pity” story”) is incredibly harmful as it still medicalizes disability. It still sees disabled people as necessarily worse off, which sucks
