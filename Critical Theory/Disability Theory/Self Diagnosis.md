## For Self Diagnosis

### Doctors have Expertise
Doctors go to medical school for a very long time to learn about symptoms for whatever condition you are self diagnosing you as. If a doctor doesnt diagnose you as something, it would be a substantial act of hubris to go against them. 

### As a Hoop
If a condition was actually as present as self diagnosers claim, then they would have gotten a diagnoses early on. The fact that it has been long enough for one to be able to diagnose themselves shows that it doenst really impact them much. 

### Self-Bias
Its really difficult to step besides yourself and anlayze yourself from a third person perspective, it requires a unbiased (or as unbiased as possible) third party to analyze you since people can convince themselves of anything. Psychologists themselves stand by a rule that they cannot diagnose themselves or diagnose family members as its so difficult to remove the self-bias one has.

### Poor Representation
Disabled people have always had awful representation in the media. Like awful awful. This provides some skeptical considerations for self diagnosis as the image of autistic people (for example) people identify with (and diagnose themselves as) is often a characature of what autistic people are. Think of Sheldon from the Big Bang Theory.

## Against Self Diagnosis

### Analogous Communities
#MyArgument 
Queer communities are analgous in this sense, especially since queerness was medicalized in the mid 20th century. It seems like queer communities operate alright without the perview of the medical establishment nowadays. Acceptance or rejection isnt based on a medical document. And it seems like any benefit to gatekeeping for autism could be equally applied to queerness. But if applied to queerness, it becomes absurd.
Transness especially faces this since gender dysphoria is in the DSM. 

### Access
Medical Diagnoses are incredibly expensive in the United States


### Stigma
Often, a medical diagnoses will mean that someone will get denied a job or overlooked for a promotion. When something is on your medical record, it takes on an entirely different meaning which isnt always possible
