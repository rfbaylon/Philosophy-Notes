#MyStance Pragmatically, it seems useful to think of autism as more than a disease. It can enhance self-understanding, provide an explanation for behavior, be the basis for an identity, be used for socializing with likeminded people, be useful in scientific research, decide who is elligable for state benefits, guide medication, form political movements, and more (Fellowes, 2024, p 24). 
It makes most sense then, to talk about autism as a set of behaviors rather than there diagnostic slip. Given this, we would argue that it would make sense to extend Judith [[Butler]]'s performativity thesis to madness.

## Against Self Diagnosis

### Doctors have Expertise
Doctors go to medical school for a very long time to learn about symptoms for whatever condition you are self diagnosing you as. If a doctor doesn't diagnose you as something, it would be a substantial act of hubris to go against them.

### As a Hoop
If a condition was actually as present as self-diagnosis claim, then they would have gotten diagnoses early on. The fact that it has been long enough for one to be able to diagnose themselves shows that it doesn't really impact them much. Unlike other communities, the mentally disabled community has an inbuilt form of protection from clout chasers that ought to be utilized.

### Self-Bias
Its really difficult to step besides yourself and analyze yourself from a third person perspective, it requires a unbiased (or as unbiased as possible) third party to analyze you since people can convince themselves of anything. Psychologists themselves stand by a rule that they cannot diagnose themselves or diagnose family members as its so difficult to remove the self-bias one has.

### Poor Representation
Disabled people have always had awful representation in the media. Like awful awful. This provides some skeptical considerations for self-diagnosis as the image of autistic people (for example) people identify with (and diagnose themselves as) is often a caricature of what autistic people are. Think Sheldon from the Big Bang Theory.

## For Self Diagnosis
 “Autistics know autism better than anybody else” (Enright, 2021)

There are three main strands to justifying self-diagnosis. Firstly, an official diagnosis is inaccessible. Secondly, being diagnosed can be harmful or not helpful. Thirdly, that the official diagnostic process is inaccurate whereas self-diagnosis is accurate.
	Fellowes 2024, p5

### Self-Identity, not Self-Diagnosis
Autism is not a disease, but an identity. To self diagnose is just to self identify. Identification with the autistic community is all it takes to be 'legitimately' autistic. 
	A2: See A2 Self Identification in [[Critical Theory/Feminism/What is a Woman|What is a Woman]]
	A2: Autism includes a small set of individuals who don't have the linguistic capacity to self-identify, therefore excluding these people from the autistic community (Chapman cited in Fellowes 2024)

### Analogous Communities
#MyArgument Queer communities are analogous in this sense, especially since queerness was medicalized in the mid-20th century. It seems like queer communities operate alright without the purview of the medical establishment nowadays. Acceptance or rejection isn't based on a medical document. And it seems like any benefit to gatekeeping for autism could be equally applied to queerness. But if applied to queerness, it becomes absurd. Transness especially faces this since gender dysphoria is in the DSM.

### Autistic People Know Best
“if someone is autistic then they will have direct access to autism so will be the best person to judge if they are autistic.”
	Fellowes 2024, p 12
Autistic folk are constantly berated by disbelief of their experiences. They are considered to be in some sense cognitively disabled and have issues with self-awareness, leading to their self-diagnosis being questioned far more than membership in other analogous communities.
	A2: Autism is an incredibly wide spectrum. This means that autism exists outside of the individuals experience and has a benchmark of comparison. 
		Fellowes 2024, p13
	A2: Self knowledge is widely considered to be inaccurate in most psychological fields. These are demonstrated in [[Cognitive Biases]] and in emperical psychological tests. 

### Anti-Psychiatry
See [[A2 Psychoanalysis]]

### Looping Effect
See [[Hacking]] 
When knowledge about a group of people changes, the population also changes. When one self-diagnoses, rather than making up a certification, it should be seen as posing a case that medicine misses. Using conceptual engineering, the autistic community can make people autistic, redefining what it means to take on the label. Autistic people are the experts, not psychiatrists.

### Access
- Medical Diagnoses are incredibly expensive and inaccessible in the United States ( #WIP How expensive?). 
- In addition, for those outside of large metropolitan areas, specialists are far harder to come across, making diagnosis far more difficult. Especially in adulthood, access to specialists is limited (can vary based on insurance providers, and waitlists). Long waiting times are also an issue. 
- In addition, it may be difficult for the individuals themelves to navigage the medical system. It may additionally be difficult for individuals to describe their symptoms to diagnosticians.

### Stigma
Often, a medical diagnosis will mean that someone will get denied a job or overlooked for a promotion. When something is on your medical record, it takes on an entirely different meaning which isn't always possible

### Demographic Bias
Autism and ADHD have been conditions studied primarily in rich, young, white boys. This demographic has a very particular way of acting, meaning the further one is from this demographic, the less likely they are to be diagnosed as having the conditions. All of the knowledge regarding these conditions is designed for one demographic, meaning that access to accurate diagnoses is unavailable to everyone equally. For example, diagnosticians are far more likely to look for special interests in computers and trains than for special interests in horses.
	A2: This is an incredibly well noted issue, to the point where its explicitly included in the DSM 5. It was medical professionals that discovered the underreporting, and it 
	A2: These days, autism is generally diagnosed by a team of interdisciplinary experts. It could be possible that all of the diagnosticians hold misleading ideas about autism, but this seems implausible.

# The Medium Matters

The Ethics Bowl case cites a lot of diagnoses coming from TikTok specifically. Many of the worries that come from self diagnosis are bolstered by TikTok, not necessarily by self diagnosis.

TikTok is used first and foremost for short-form content, usually around 15 seconds at most. This is not a place where nuanced discussions of disability can happen. We should not at all be surprised that many kids are getting an either narrow or just incorrect picture of what a community looks like since the medium itself disincentivizes nuanced content.

This is to say that self-diagnosis through education and familiarity with a community could very well be possible, though TikTok self-diagnosis is problematic. While Tiktok may serve as a useful tool in getting a conversation started, it can’t be relied upon for intimate knowledge of autism.
