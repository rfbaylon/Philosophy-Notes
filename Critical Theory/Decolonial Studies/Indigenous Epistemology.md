Need an account of epistemic sovereignty

Without epistemic sovereignty, Indigenous peoples are vulnerable to 3 distinct harms:
1. Treatment as an object of study
2. Assimilation into the dominant culture
	1. Creates self doubt / hatred as there is no solid epistemic foundation to fall back on.
	2. "Kill the Indian, save the man"
3. Categorization / Essentialism
	1. There are no resources to combat harmful stereotypes
	Indigenous Philosophy course


Most of Indigenous thought attempts to contradict Universalism, which is found in most Western ethics. 
**Universalism**: While we are separated by different practices, norms, institutions, etc., we are more alike than not. Therefore, we need to cast off what separates us and embrace this commonality. In doing so, we develop greater empathy, compassion, and eliminate strife. 

# A Positive Account

There are 5 parts of knowing
1. Mind
2. Body
3. Spirit
4. Emotion
5. Relationality (w/ the environment)
[[Kimmerer]] claims that Western epistemology only cares about the first two. It tries to distance itself from politics, action, culture, and motivation to remain 'objective,' but misses important information in doing so. Everything is interrelated.

### Stuff from Thoreau
"If I wished a boy to know something about the arts and sciences, for instance, I would not pursue the common course, which is merely to send him to the neighborhood of some professor, where anything is professed and practiced but the art of life; - to survey the world through a telescope or a microscope,m and never with his natural eye; to study chemistry, and not learn how his bread is made, or mechanics and not learn how it s earned; to discover new satellites to Neptune and not detect the motes in his eyes, to to what vagabond he is a satellite himself; or to be devoured by the monsters that swarm all around him, while contemplating the monsters in a drop of vinegar. Which would be most advanced in a month -- the boy who had made his own jackknife from the ore which he had dug and smelted, reading as much as would be necessary for this, -- or the boy who had attended the lectures on metallurgy at the Institute in the meanwhile, and had received a Rogers' penknife from his father? Which would be most likely to cut his fingers? To my astonishment, I was informed on leaving college that I had studied Navigation! -- why, if I had taken one turn down the harbour I should have known more about it."
	[[Walden]] 45-46

"Men say they know many things;
But lo! they have taken wings --
The arts and sciences,
And a thousand appliances;
The wind that blows
Is all that anybody knows."
