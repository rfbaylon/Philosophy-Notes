Need an account of epistemic sovereignty

Without epistemic sovereignty, Indigenous peoples are vulnerable to 3 distinct harms:
1. Treatment as an object of study
2. Assimilation into the dominant culture
	1. Creates self doubt / hatred as there is no solid epistemic foundation to fall back on.
	2. "Kill the Indian, save the man"
3. Categorization / Essentialism
	1. There are no resources to combat harmful stereotypes
	Indigenous Philosophy course


# A Positive Account

Most of Indigenous thought attempts to contradict Universalism, which is found in most Western ethics. 
**Universalism**: While we are separated by different practices, norms, institutions, etc., we are more alike than not. Therefore, we need to cast off what separates us and embrace this commonality. In doing so, we develop greater empathy, compassion, and eliminate strife.
