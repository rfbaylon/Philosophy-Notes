Need an account of epistemic sovereignty

Without epistemic sovereignty, Indigenous peoples are vulnerable to 3 distinct harms:
1. Treatment as an object of study
2. Assimilation into the dominant culture
	1. Creates self doubt / hatred as there is no solid epistemic foundation to fall back on.
	2. "Kill the Indian, save the man"
3. Categorization / Essentialism
	1. There are no resources to combat harmful stereotypes
	Indigenous Philosophy course


Most of Indigenous thought attempts to contradict Universalism, which is found in most Western ethics. 
**Universalism**: While we are separated by different practices, norms, institutions, etc., we are more alike than not. Therefore, we need to cast off what separates us and embrace this commonality. In doing so, we develop greater empathy, compassion, and eliminate strife. 
# A Positive Account

There are 5 parts of knowing
1. Mind
2. Body
3. Spirit
4. Emotion
5. Relationality (w/ the environment)
[[Kimmerer]] claims that Western epistemology only cares about the first two. It tries to distance itself from politics, action, culture, and motivation to remain 'objective,' but misses important information in doing so. Everything is interrelated.
