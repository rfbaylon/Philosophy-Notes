I dont have great notes here, but here are some loose thoughts

In order for decolonization to occur, settlers must become immigrants to the sovereign territories of Indigenous folk. 

One relinquishes their title as settler when they play by the rules of the indigenous land they are on. (Tuck and Yang)

There are concerns of democracy. For those on the land, would they not have a legitimate stake in the goverment? If immigrants need to play by native rules in order to not be settlers, this implictily means they dont deserve a say as to what the rules are.
