# Aesthetic Realism

## Aesthetic Realism
See [[Plato]], [[Murdoch]],

### Argument from Moral Realism
See
Moral realism has more commitments than aestheic realism. Moral realism makes claims about *both* what is good (eg pleasure is good) *and* what you should do about it (one ought to maximize pleasure). Aesthetic realism only makes a claim about the former (i.e., it doesnt claim that its *wrong* to make bad art, only that the art is bad). If moral realism is true, it should follow that aesthetic realism is true since it has substantially less commitments.

Does it really matter whether art is objective or subjective?

## Aesthetic Quietism

### Half baked thought
Why  do I care about whether beauty is objective? All I can get are appearances of objects, all I can say are how objects impact me. The question is entirely outside of what we are able to answer. Even if we could, Im not sure how much it changes
