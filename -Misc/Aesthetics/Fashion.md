“In the classical European humanistic tradition, fashion was always thought to be antithetical to good taste,” Jukka Gronow writes in [_The Sociology of Taste_](https://rstyle.me/+r_irty2Sr-xodNU8l_nZdQ). “A person blindly following the whims of fashion was without style, whereas a man of style—or a gentleman—used his own power of judgment. Immanuel [[Kant]] shared this conception with many of his contemporaries.”

In his book [_Taste and Fashion_](https://rstyle.me/+EcdAl7b33w1VbHezfyKofQ), he wrote: “In every period costume has some essential line, and when we look back over the fashions of the past we can see quite plainly what it is, and can see what is surely very strange, that the forms of dresses, apparently so haphazard, so dependent on the whim of the designer, have an extraordinary relevance to the spirit of the age.”


Before the enlightenment, taste was a caste system. You needed to be born into good taste in order to access it. The aesthetics of the enlightenment -- most notbaly [[Kant]] -- changed that, and believed that anyone could have good taste, and that taste was a learnable skill. All one had to do in order to get this good taste is to reason well. Bordeiu came after them and claims that [[Kant]] and the Dress Doctors dont actually access a universal taste, just the taste of the wealthy. Their entire project is trying to make poor people look rich. 
Since then, fashion has boomed in that there are more and more legitimate syels and tastes that can look good. 

my body is an art peice that i always wear. if i care about what my music or movie tastes say about me, i should doubly care about my fashion choices. i can choose whether or not to reveal my music taste, but not my fashion taste. the same goes for physique and the same goes, id guess, for interior decoration.
