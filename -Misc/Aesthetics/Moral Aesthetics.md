"Beauty is truth, truth beauty -- that is all
Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know,"
	[[Keats]]

	"Truth never signifies correctness of intellectual statements about things, or truth as its meaning is now influenced by science. It denotes the wisdom by which men live..."

"the truest philosophy is the best material for the greatest poet" T.S Eliot

"poetry teaches as friends and life teach, by being, and not by express intent"

One of the primary ways of understanding ethics is through proper attention to the beautiful. Correct vision of the world unveils both its beauty and allows it to be properly ethically judged. 
	[[Sovereignty of Good]], loc 792

Primarily, contemplation of both natural beauty or artistic beauty are important for moral development. As you unselfishly observe nature and revel in its absurdity, you properly attend to the scene as it is. Similar with art. When art is unselfish and raw, it shows the world as is, drawing attention to the minute parts of the world that cohere into a unity.
	[[Sovereignty of Good]], loc 1427


One great defect in what passes as morality is its anesthetic (super interesting broken up both ways: an-esthetic and anesthetic) quality. Instead of exemplifying wholehearted action, it takes the form of grudging piecemeal concessions to the demands of duty. But illustrations may only obscure the fact that any practical activity will, provided that it is integrated and moves by its own urge to fulfillment, have esthetic quality

### Aesthetic Incompatibility
If art were only as good as the philosopher behind them, then it would not make sense to like two artists who disagree with each other philosophically. If we believe Dante, we must hate Milton's work. If we like Lucretius, we must find both defective.

### Art precedes Ethics
"Imagination is the chief instrument of the good... The great secret of morals is love, or a going out of our nature and the identification of ourselves with the beautiful which exists in thought, action, or person, not our own. A man to be greatly good must imagine intesely and comprehensively"
	(Mary? Percy?) Shelley, cited in [[Art as Experience]] 362

"Were art an acknowledged power in human association and not treated as the pleasuring of an idle moment or as a means of ostentatious display, and were morals understood to be identical with every aspect of value that is shared in experience, the "problem" of the relation of art and morals would not exist"
	[[Art as Experience]] 362
