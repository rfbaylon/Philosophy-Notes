I feel very frightened by the way that a lot of the platforms we use to find information, which I use and like a lot, also encourage us to think the same ways and enjoy the same things. I look at something like Bama Rush, and I feel very scared that it is a product of and promoter of women all doing and wearing the same things. I know I sound crazy, but I can’t help how I feel!

I think the more I came to realize that, the more I found my ways to things that delighted me, that I think are important to pay attention to, that make my relationships better and my work more interesting.
