"Flowers can be enjoyed without knowing about the interactions of soil, air, moisture, and seeds of which they are a the result. But they cannot be understood without taking just these interactions into account -- and theory is a matter of understanding... It should be just a  commonplace that esthetic understanding -- as distinct from sheer personal enjoyment -- must start with the soil, air, and light out of which things esthetically admirable arise."

# Art for Art's Sake

## A2 Art for Art's Sake

### Art as Communal
This idea is incredibly novel and very unique. Anyone living in ancient Athens would never understand this idea as art, such as the Parthenon, communal baths, or pottery, was always for the sake of the community or served some practical purpose. Art for art's sake would be stupid -- only someone with far too much time on their hands would do that.
	[[Art as Experience]], 6
Works of art that are not remote from common life, that are widely enjoyed in a community, are signs of a unified collective life. But they are also marvelous aids in the creation of such a life.

# Art as Expression
## Art as Expression
[[Dewey]] believes expression to be one of the functions of art, but not the only ingredient to interpretation.
"Art expresses, it does not state"
	[[Art as Experience]], 140

Art is expressed from the artist the way juice is ex-pressed from the wine press -- taking both environmental and internal conditions to constitute the expression.
	[[Art as Experience]], 67
## A2 Art as Expression
This idea views the artist as an atomized individual. Art is never mere self expression, but rather an expression of the social and material environment. "What is sometimes called an act of self-expression might better be termed one of self-exposure; it discloses character"
	[[Art as Experience]], 64


Matisse is reported to have said "When a painting is finished, it is like a new-born child. The artist himself must have time for understanding it." I think, when talking to artists, many of them dont really understand what they have made, making it impossible to be an (at least fully intentioned) expression of themselves.

# Art as Aesthetic Experience

"The esthetic... is the clarified and intensified development of traits that belong to every normally complete experience"
	[[Art as Experience]], 48

Aesthetic experience happens when any experience is "lifted high above the threshold of perception and (is) made manifest for its own sake"
	[[Art as Experience]], 59
	This doesnt make sense to me -- isnt this art for arts sake kind of argument?
	This also seems to claim that art is just really cool perception. Is that fair?

"A work of art, no matter how old and classic is actually, not just potentially, a work of art only when it lives in some individualized experience"
	[[Art as Experience]], 113

The delight in art springs from the relationships that determine life
	[[Art as Experience]] 156

"Art is a quality of activity"
	[[Art as Experience]] 232
### Temporality
See also C. Thi. Nguyen's idea of art-as-game
Art is like a game. The aesthetic experience  lies within the sitting with it, solving it like a puzzle. To merely learn the meaning of the art through a wikipedia summary would be like buying Portal and following a YouTube walkthrough to a T. The aesthetic part of it isn't the literal content of the piece, but the process of coming to terms with it.
	C. Thi. Nguyen on an Ezra Klein podcast, somewhere.

A drama or novel is not the final sentence, but rather the rhythms, characterizations, and story that leads there. 
	[[Art as Experience]], 57

### As an embodied natural rhythm
The 5 systems of rhythm:
movement, color, spatial intervals, depth, luminosity.

"Every uniformity and regularity of change in nature is a rhythm"
	[[Art as Experience]], 155

Often serenity and sublimity are overhyped in art. Part of what makes a sunset beautiful is the harsh tensions and clashes of colors that paint the sky, only to be released in their hombre when they meet. The beauty of the sunset lies in its building of tension in color and release.
	[[Art as Experience]] 166

Art is an organization of energies that have movements like a story or song, where some energies rest others begin. The rest has the function of delimiting and individuating, while the hype builds hype

# Art as Relationship
How good art is is how intimate the relations of its components are

"To say that one part of a painting, drama , or novel is too weak is to say that some related part is too strong -- and visa versa"
	[[Art as Experience]], 187
## Art as Relationship
Organized design + shape = form
## A2 Art as Relationship
This view relies too heavily on shape, form, and composition, while seeing color or tone as merely superimposed flourishes.
	[[Art as Experience]], 107
	This feels kind of strawmanny to me tbh -- can colors not relate? Its more likely I misunderstand (especially given the above quote from 121)

# Art as Play
See C Thi Nguyen (Kind of?)

## A2 Art as Play

### Misses concrete analysis
When someone is criticizing art, they are trying to say something about the world -- something legitimate and worth listening to. At least that's the goal. The play theory of art misses this important function of art.
	[[Art as Experience]] 290 

# Art as Representation
See [[Aristotle]], [[Plato]]

Dr Barnes: "Reference to the real world does not disappear from art as forms cease to be those of actually existing things, any more than objectivity disappears from science when it ceases to talk in terms of earth, fire, air, and water, and substitutes for these things the less easily recognizable hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon"
	Cited in [[Art as Experience]], 97
"Abstraction is usually associated with distinctively intellectual undertakings. Actually, it is found in every work of art"
	[[Art as Experience]], 98

"The painter and poet like the scientific inquirer know the delights of discovery"
	[[Art as Experience]], 144

### Representation is of Forms!
[[Aristotle]]

### Representation is of The Divine!
[[Plato]]
This is slightly different from representation, [[Plato]] says that art is supposed to *imitate*, not represent the divine.
	A2: [[Plato]], this is ghostly and incoherent ramblings. What does "the divine" really mean if our senses and other human faculties are faulty? This is even *granting* that it makes sense about our human faculties being faulty
		[[Art as Experience]] 350
	A2: There are no essences in the first place, no universals. 
		[[Art as Experience]] 350
## A2 Representation
Matisse says the camera is a great boon to painters as it frees them from needing to copy objects
	Cited in [[Art as Experience]] 86 but cannot find any primary source
	I also found this in a Cuck Philosophy video on AI art

Given this lens, judges and critics will then view art by their own preconceived notions of what the represented object ought to be, rather than with the tools that either the authors want or many audience members want.

When someone complained to Matisse that she had never seen a woman who looked like the one in his painting, he replied: "Madam, that is not a woman; that is a picture."

### Against Realism
"If the measure of artistic merit were ability to paint... grapes on a canvas so that birds come to peck at them, a scarecrow would be a work of consummate fine art when it succeeds at keeping away the crows"
	[[Art as Experience]] 209
	In other words, a painting ought to emphasize the *characteristic* reality of the subjects, not necessarily just replicating them. If I wanted to see a realistic painting of a grape, I would look at a grape. I want to know what Dali saw as unique to the grape, I want a thesis. Realism just gets the function of art wrong.

Note: This perhaps is a strawman of the representational view. *literal* representation was never the important part. [[Aristotle]] for example held the representation to be of the forms, not the physical world.

### There are no 'Universals'
Many of the representational theories of art rely on universal human nature or fundamental principles of the universe to be what they represent. This is, for example, what makes Great Art timeless. [[Dewey]] is skeptical that there are any universals under which art can always point to as environments, experiences, and people are always changing.
	[[Art as Experience]] 300

# Parts of art

### Form
Form is the operation of forces that carry the experience of an event, object, scene, and situation to its own integral fulfillment. It includes conditions such as continuity, cumulation, conservation, tension, and anticipation
	[[Art as Experience]] 142-3

- *Pauses* are holes when they do not accentuate mass and define figures
- *Extension* sprawls and finally benumbs if it does not interact with place as to assume intelligible distribution
- *Mass* contracts and expands, asserts itself and yields, according to its relations to other spatial and enduring things.
	[[Art as Experience]] 220
### Color
Delacroix says of inferior artists of his day that they used coloration rather than color; theya pplied color *to* the represented objects instead of making them out of color.
	[[Art as Experience]] 208
