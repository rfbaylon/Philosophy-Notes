The first thing to understand is that “good taste” is a judgment that _others_ make about you, and they will come to that conclusion based on summarizing all of your observable lifestyle choices. In this day and age, there is no longer a single, authoritative standard of “good taste;” each community has its own standards for what identities are afforded esteem, and taste is the vehicle upon which they judge “who you are.” So good taste requires two things: (1) Proposing an identity that happens to be valued in your community of choice. (2) Using your lifestyle choices to clearly, congruently, and authentically communicate that identity. Both are key.
