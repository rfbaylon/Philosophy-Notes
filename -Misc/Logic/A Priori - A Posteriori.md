# A Priority

*"Reason by all its a priori principles never teaches us anything more than objects of possible experience, and even of these nothing more than can be known in experience"* ([[Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics]], 110)


This is the totality of all a priori knowledge available to the human understanding according to [[Kant]]
