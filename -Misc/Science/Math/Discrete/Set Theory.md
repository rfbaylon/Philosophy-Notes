## Sets 

#### Popular Sets
$\mathbb{N}$ - Natural Numbers
$\mathbb{Z}$ - Integers
$\mathbb{Q}$ - Rational Numbers
$\mathbb{R}$ - Real numbers


$\in$ - element in
$\notin$ - element not in

#### Set Characteristics
$|S|$ - the Cardinality of a set. Cardnality is the number of unique elements in the set. 

#### Set Interactions
$\cup$ - Union 
	Equivalent to "or" ($\lor$) in logic
$\cap$ - Intersection
	Equivalent to "and" ($\land$) in logic
\- - set difference
	The set of A without anything in B
### Laws

#### DeMorgans Laws
$\lnot (A \cap B) = \lnot A \cup \lnot B$

#### Cartesian Product
The cartesian product of two sets A and B is the set of all ordered paris (a, b) where a $\in$ A and b $\in$ B.

A={1, 2} B={X,Y}
AxB = {(1, X), (1, Y), (2, X), (2, Y)}
