## A2 Generalization

### Generalization is Sometimes Good
We use heuristics all of the time in order to make decisions about safety. The person wearing tattered clothing and looks as though they us meth probably isn't the safest person to walk alone at night with, and it would seem that this form of generalization would be good, even if it does discriminate. 

### We Can Only Generalize
Even if an employer were to give a merit based test to prospective employees, the hiring results would still be based off of generalizations of "people who do well on this test tend to be a good fit for the job"
