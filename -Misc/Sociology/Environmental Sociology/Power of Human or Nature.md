“Braudel and Adams saw natural landscapes as foundational-the "vast uncontrollables," as Braudel described them, in human history. Cronon and Merchant gave near-absolute agency to commercial capitalist culture.” (Second Nature; Environmental History of New England, 8-9)

## Environmental Determinism
See [[Free Will & Determinism]]
Nature -----> Humans

The environment of a certain area will determine how people will behave; it will determine number of farmers, disease, economic output, etc. 
	"In Huntington's thinking, climate was the variable that explained why one civilization advanced and another remained primitive, why one was imperialistic and the other passive." [[Second Nature; Environmental History of New England]], 3

## Human Agency
See [[Cronon]]
Humans -----> Nature

Environmental Conditions do not effect the way humans behave; humans will dominate their environment in similar ways despite their natural resources and local land formations.
	This view came especially into popularity as the Industrial Revolution came into fruition and made man solely reliable on "artificial" factory produced goods.

"Higbee saw nature as a foundation for unbounded cultural choice: a presence without causal force." (Second Nature; Environmental History of New England, 7)

### Argument from Changing Telos
See [[Cronon]]

Because different areas (that remain similar over time) will change so much according to human assignments of telos, it shows that human desire can shape any form of land.
	"Early settlers viewed islands as part of a wilderness zone made up of uncharted shoals, unpredictable currents, and violent weather. Later cultures valued the same islands in different ways, using these places for fishing stages, livestock enclosures, military refuges, and Indian concentration camps. Nature was later devalued as islands became dumping grounds for the poor, the diseased, and the criminal or were used for garbage disposal and water treatment plants. Finally, their natures were revalued as recreational spaces, laboratories of ecological evolution, or fragile and precious targets of preservation." (Second Nature; Environmental History of New England, 9-10)
