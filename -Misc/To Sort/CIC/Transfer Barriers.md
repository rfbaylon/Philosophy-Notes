Art has been w DHE for 14 months
CS transfer is epecially bumpy
You want to make a diad, not a system (?)
Most transfer is based on geography
Top down control of curriculum is undesirable (connecticut as example)
Virginia community college is an example of a good CC policy
average credit loss is a scarecrow because it considers systems not diads.

public transfer is in flux
dept commissioner (arts boss) is also 14 months old
as did dept commissioner of policy and two others
steering comittee has very little power
policy is extremely vague
stick to our research, share the research timeline. 


The 2/4 community college-baccalaureate transfer function is one of the most important state policy issues in higher education because its success(or failure) is central to many dimensions of state higher education performance, including access, equity, affordability, cost effectiveness, degree productivity, and quality.
	 Wellman, 2002, p. 3

Moreover, community collegesserve as “the main gateway into higher education for minority and work-ing-class students” (Dougherty, 1991, p. 312).

Taxonomy from (Lyon & Denner, 2019)
* Pathway setbacks: When students are pushed back to an earlier stage in the CS pathway.
* Pathway discontinuities: When a student steps out of college for a time and returns or "swirls" between different colleges.
* Pathway departures: When a student either changes their major from CS or drops out of college entirely.

"Chapter 15A, Section 9 (v) of the General Laws of Massachusetts, which specifies that the Board of Higher Education should “develop and implement a transfer compact for the purpose of facilitating and fostering the transfer of students without the loss of academic credit or standing from one public institution to another.”
	Murnane et al. 2022, 

"For example, among students in the 2010 MACC entry cohort who had earned an associate degree before transferring, 69% of those from higher-income families earned a bachelor’s degree within four years after transferring, compared to 60% of those from low-income families."
	Murnane et al. 2022, p24

Communtiy colleges are not incentivized to pursue transfer. Out of the 50% of funding CCs get from the state, only 5% is determined by transfer. 
"Associate degree completions are weighted at 15% and certificate completions at 10%. Transfers to four-year institutions are weighted at 5%. Completion of developmental math and English courses are weighted at 8% and 7% respectively. The last 5% of the weights reward colleges for full-time equivalent enrollment awards reached per fiscal year."

Communtiy college students do worse than resident students within the first year of transfer (transfer shock), but on average do better in upper level courses than resident students.

## Solutions
Four-years should make credit acceptance determinations at the point of acceptance rather than at enrollment (Wyner 2016)
# Pathway Setbacks
## Poor Advising

Lyon & Denner (2019) talked to students (Filipe is best example) who just got completely wrong information from advisors, meaning that they were unable to graduate on time.

High case loads (find approx range (700?)) mean advisors never know their students and cannot guide them effectively.

High advisor turnover due to poor pay means students will be unable to know their advisor and may get poor information. A constant hiring of new advisors also means very few have substantial experience.

Packard et al. (2011) find good advisors as helpful for women in CS specifically. (look into this)
### Solutions
* Better 3rd party tools (such as Transferology or Assist.org)
* More intuitional support for advisors
* Specific CS advisors
* More advisor buy in to the curriculum
* Perhaps have some faculty double as advisors, if possible

## Nonuniform Transfer Requirements

lengthy testimonial
	"What’s most difficult? I would say the courses and the courses in relation to what schools require, because it’s such a pain figuring out what classes that I need to take. It’s a game trying to figure out what class I should take for what because, at least the way I figured it out after talking to the counselor and then trying to figure out on my own, the first thing I have to do is decide what colleges are my top goals and from that I have to decide what classes I need from each college and what overlaps and what doesn’t. Let’s say I wanted to go to [UCX1] and [UCX2] and then [Cal State], for example. [UCX1] might want chemistry, but [UCX2] won’t even have that as a requirement for transfer, but might have it as a recommended course. That’s just for chemistry. Then you have to do the same process for physics, math, everything like that. I know for a fact that for [UCX1] the minimum required transfer is just [C++ Programming class], but at [UCX2] I think it’s both [C++ Programming class] and [Data Structures]. Then [UCX1] wants physics A, B and D, but at [UCX2] they want only A and C or A, C and D. It’s a matching game, and then I have to make sure I get the courses in alignment with how I prioritize each school and then I have to make sure I’m doing well in those classes and not having to repeat, because if I repeat one that’s a prerequisite for another that pushes back the whole line. That could push me back a year and a half." (Lyon & Denner, 2016, p12)

On average, transfer students lose 13 credit hours through the transition from a community college to a university, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office.

Relevant info:
- Most students planned to remain local (Lyon & Denner, 2016; Fink, Fletcher, Dundar, 2016)
### Solutions
* More and better articulation agreements
* Clearer and better information access on CC websites
* More institutional support for advisors
* Better 3rd party tools (such as Transferology or Assist.org)

## Math Requirements
Also reason for Departure

### Solutions
* Redesign community college pathways to be more supportive (Fink, Fletcher, Dundar, 2016, p15 has a lot of sources for this, look into)
* Include only prerequisites that are truly necessary (Fink, Fletcher, Dundar, 2016, p15 has a lot of sources for this, look into).

## High GPA Requirements
High GPA requirements cause students to drop and re-enroll in classes to keep up a GPA. This not only interrupts students who are incentivized to take harder classes later, but causes students in half empty class rooms to lose confidence in themselves (Lyon & Denner, 2016, p10). Also insensitive to student emergencies.
### Solutions
* Less harsh GPA requirements
* More opportunities for grade fogiveness

## Curricular Flexibility
This issue is especially prevalent in CS because community college CS programs tend to have a more applied focus and because expectations for coursework vary widely accross CS programs (Fink, Fletcher, Dundar, 2016, p14)

* Required classes fill up, pushing graduation dates out for students who cant take those classes
* Students are discouraged from 'discovering' computer science late in the game
* Insensitive to family, financial, or other emergencies or other reasons minoritized students would need to take a break from classes (Lyon & Denner, 2016, p11)
### Solutions
* Less prerequisites

## Poor Instruction

Microagressions and low expectations of minoritized students cause them to think that computer science isnt for them, leading to a higher drop rate. 
### Solutions
* Stack your best teachers in the first three classes (students will put up with worse teachers farther down the line of their career)

## Poor Motivators
- Lack of knowledge about future CS opportunities
### Solutions
* Partnerships with industry (experiential learning) (Lyon & Denner, 2016)
* Meaningful and practical assignments in early CS courses
	Female and underrepresented minority students at community colleges were excited about their CS courses when the tasks seemed applicable to real-world interests and challenges (Lyon & Denner, 2016)


## Intimidating Culture
Transfer students are last in line at 4ys for institutional support (scholarships, housing, etc)

Lack of support is a s

Beyond this, Denner et al. 2015 points out that increased expectation of success results in help seeking behavior (such as peer networking, office hours attendance) which reinforces their intentions to pursue CS (p356)
### Solutions
* Bolster on campus clubs for more community between marginalized students
* Bolster a collaborative, rather than competitive, culture
* 

# Pathway Discontinuities

## Lack of transferability between CC's 
See 

### Solutions
* More AAs/ uniformity between community colleges
* Easier re-entry (this might be its own issue -- fix if so)

# Pathway Departures

## Financial Inability

> "As appealing as it sounds free [community college] tuition has not touched transfer, a core mission of community colleges and why many students enroll in the first place. it may help students get started, but it does not help see them through the process and beyond... As long as transfer is not given the same value as freshman recruitment and admissions in the form of generous financial aid packages, the financial concerns experienced by low-income students and students of color will continue to pose the most severe friction"
	[[On My Own]], 145-146

### Solution
* [Last mile scholarships](https://www.lastmile-ed.org/)
* Research from Northeastern University shows that students in the tuition-free community college program are three times more likely to graduate from community college than peers who don’t have the support associated with this program.

## Lack of Readiness

### Solutions
* An actual introduction to CS (CS0)

## Lure of Jobs

### Solutions
* More and better career information (also ties to poor motivators)

## Lure of Other Majors

### Solutions
* Combined majors
* Offer a more flexible BA
