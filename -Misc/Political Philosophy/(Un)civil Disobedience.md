Protest: A legal demonstration with a political aim (ex: a march, a boycott, *)
Civil Disobedience: A non-violent illegal action with a political aim (ex: trespassing, disturbing the peace)
Uncivil Disobedience is: civil disobedience that fall short of the standards of civility by failing to be public, refusing to accept punishment, or showing no respect or loyalty to the system, etc., and most notably involving violence. (whistleblowing, hacktivism, and ecotage)

## Framework
For uncivil (and civil) disobedience t

For this case, we will be weighing moral *cost* and *benefit*. By cost, we mean:
- the amount of harm
- the direction of harm

Its simply false that civil disobedience is less costly in all situations compared to uncivil disobedience. A grafitti artists tagging a building or a whistleblower causing embarassment to an institution will often 'cost less' compared with widescale political disruptions. 

## Good Means
Minimize cost insofar as it doesnt impact the results


- Unabomber setting off a bomb to kill state rep killing like 40 extra innocent people is awful  
- Killing my room mate because I’m mad about police brutality will not reasonably achieve the goals I want (even if the goals are good)  
- George Floyd Protestors looting Target isn't going to do shit

**Epistemic Limits**
- Expectation of Outcome  
  - Lines get messier regarding systemic issues, but this line still exists (somewhere\!)
## Good Ends

Causes that have a legitimate normative case are the only causes that allow for uncivil disobedience.

### Fairness

Laws that unjustly distribute resources to one class over another is a simple example. Take Jim Crow laws in the 40s. A White man has an interesting job, is constantly served first, is treated with respect among his neighbors, and gets social priority in most things. This is due to his skin tone, which lacks moral relevance. This is unfair, as goods are unevenly distributed among people for no reason.

Morality would require the White man to do what he can to redistribute some of the goods, and the Black man to receive some of the goods, even if this redistribution is illegal. The moral good comes before the law. 

This is, in our minds, what differentiates the KKK from the Black Panthers or a Swastika vandalist from a public artist: the existence of both the goods and their fair distribution.

**Epistemic Limits**

- Reasonable Belief  
  - If there is reasonable disagreement (a strong argument for both sides), you just shouldn’t do the uncivil disobedience.   
  - Duty of the people doing it to be well informed about the issue (ex if you think there is a conspiracy, you need reasonable evidence)
