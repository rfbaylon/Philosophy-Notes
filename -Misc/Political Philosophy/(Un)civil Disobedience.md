Protest: A legal demonstration with a political aim (ex: a march, a boycott, *)
Civil Disobedience: A non-violent illegal action with a political aim (ex: trespassing, disturbing the peace)
Uncivil Disobedience is: civil disobedience that fall short of the standards of civility by failing to be public, refusing to accept punishment, or showing no respect or loyalty to the system, etc., and most notably involving violence. (whistleblowing, hacktivism, and ecotage)

**Thesis: Both Civil and Uncivil Disobedience are permissible, and perhaps required, when the disobedience is proportionate.**


## Good Means
For uncivil (and civil) disobedience to be permissible, it must minimize the cost

For this case, we will be weighing moral *cost* and *benefit*. By cost, we mean:
- the amount of harm
- the direction of harm

Obviously, the amount of harm must be considered for any action, but we want to defend the direction of harm as well. By translating some norms from Just War Theory,  when it comes to the distribution of costs, it is better to distribute the harm among those most responsible for violence than the victims. Proportaionality allows for more harms to go to perpetrators.

**Epistemic Limits**
- Expectation of Outcome  
  - Lines get messier regarding systemic issues, but this line still exists (somewhere\!)

### Upshot
Our proportionality framework would allow for some cases of uncivil disobedience to be *more* permissible than some cases of indiscriminate civil disobedience.
	Justifying Uncivil Disobedience 97

Its simply false that civil disobedience is less costly in all situations compared to uncivil disobedience. A grafitti artists tagging a building or a whistleblower causing embarassment to an institution will often 'cost less' compared with widescale political disruptions. 



#### Examples

- Unabomber setting off a bomb to kill state rep killing like 40 extra innocent people is awful  
- Killing my room mate because I’m mad about police brutality will not reasonably achieve the goals I want (even if the goals are good)  
- George Floyd Protestors looting Target isn't going to do shit


## Good Ends
Causes that have a legitimate normative case are the only causes that allow for uncivil disobedience.
#### A Note On Legitimacy
For a act of uncivil disobedience to be permissible, the end one is fighting for must be legitimately good.

One potential issue with our framework is that we dont make room for pluralism: there is no "I disagree, but its your right."

### Fairness

Laws that unjustly distribute resources to one class over another is a simple example. Take Jim Crow laws in the 40s. A White man has an interesting job, is constantly served first, is treated with respect among his neighbors, and gets social priority in most things. This is due to his skin tone, which lacks moral relevance. This is unfair, as goods are unevenly distributed among people for no reason.

Morality would require the White man to do what he can to redistribute some of the goods, and the Black man to receive some of the goods, even if this redistribution is illegal. The moral good comes before the law. 

This is, in our minds, what differentiates the KKK from the Black Panthers or a Swastika vandalist from a public artist: the existence of both the goods and their fair distribution.

**Epistemic Limits**

- Reasonable Belief  
  - If there is reasonable disagreement (a strong argument for both sides), you just shouldn’t do the uncivil disobedience.   
  - Duty of the people doing it to be well informed about the issue (ex if you think there is a conspiracy, you need reasonable evidence)
