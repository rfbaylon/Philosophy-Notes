Citizenship serves three functions:
- Allocating rights to reside in a particular location
- Being a unit of popular sovreignty 
	- (the state belongs to the people, and its these people the state belongs to)
- Creating co-authors of laws, establishing norms of civic participation

[[Donaldson]] and [[Kymlicka]] argue that too much focus is on the third function (a la [[Rawls]] and [[Habermas]]), but it discludes infants, disabled people, and animals. But on top of this, a lot of the disability movement has focused on "Nothing about us without us," bucking the old paternalistic model. In order for many to make these decisions though, they require some sort of assisted autonomy. "In other words, political agency, should be seen as something that inheres in a relationship amongst citizens, not as an attribute of individuals that exists prior to their interaction. It is not that people are first agents and *therefore* accorded citizenship"

There are 3 parts to citizenship
1. Residency (they belong there)
2. Inclusion in the sovereign people (interests count for determining public good)
3. Agency (they should be able to shape the rules of cooperation)
