### Public Interest is Private Interest
[[Hegel]]
The first, on basically Hegelian lines, is to take it that the public interest is prior to and constitutive of private interests, just as the historically constituted organic form of the state constitutes the nature of private autonomy. This theory turns the question of the nature of the public interest into a problem in the philosophy of history. 
	I cannot develop this theory here, but I would remark that this theory offers few internal safeguards against actual state despotism, whatever its theoretical merits. I suggest that this reinstates the problem of the public interest in an inverse form—that is, the determination of its limits and the need to draw a line to define what is not in the scope of the public interest. 

### Contractarian
[[Rousseau]]
The second, on liberal contractarian lines, is to identify the public interest with the conditions necessary to secure the private benefits derivable from the establishment and maintenance of political association. 



### Solidarity
The third approach is to identify the public interest with the moral demands of solidarity. I will argue that both the liberal contractarian and the solidarity theories of the public interest essentially replace the idea of “public interest” with a conception of the demands of justice.
