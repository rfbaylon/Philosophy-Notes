\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Community Colleges}
%General
Massachusetts' community colleges are important institutions, both in their wide reaching scale and the life outcomes they can promise students. The fifteen Massachusetts community colleges In 2022, Massachusetts community colleges accounted for 46\% of all undergraduate enrollment and served 112,000 students. 

% SES
Part of what makes these institutions so attractive is their promise of boosting socioeconomic status for students. Associates degrees increase average lifetime earnings by \$450,000 for just two years of schooling. Perhaps more importantly though, community colleges give students pathways to earn bachelors degrees which, on average, increase lifetime earnings by \$1,000,000. Additionally, community colleges are historically cheap to attend, making their value enormous to low income students. The recent MassEducate program entirely eliminates tuition for Massachusetts residents without a prior degree, making the pathway to higher earning more possible than ever. 

%Diverse
On top of economic opportunity for students, community colleges offer the workforce a far more diverse student base than their four year counterparts. Half of all Hispanic students, 43\% of first generation students, and 52\% of Black students are community college educated (Lyon and Denner, 2016). Half of women in science, technology, engineering, or math (STEM) are community college educated (Lyon and Denner, 2016). Nationally, community colleges have far more disabled people (20\% of the student body). For Massachusetts specifically, of public four-year transfers, Black and Hispanic students each made up 21\% compared to White and Asian students each making up 13\% of the cohort. The more diverse student body of community colleges also allows minoritized people to more freely explore fields traditionally dominated by white men, generating more curiosity and more degrees for minoritized populations (Lyon \& Denner, 2016). Community colleges are a well of underrepresented voices, making their success vital for social justice outcomes within the state.

### EDITED
% Difficult
Many students aspire to earn a bachelors degree but never end up with one. Nationally, 81\% of students begin community college with the intention of transfer, while only 33\% actually transfer within 6 years, and only 14\% complete the bachelor degree (Valesco et al., 2023). A myriad of obstacles lie in students' path including, but not limited to: cost of tuition, poor advising structures, unreasonable transfer pathways, lack of class offerings within their schedules, nontransferable courses, poor social/emotional student support, and so-called "transfer shock" when students are becoming acclimated to their new school (Lakin \& Elliott, 2016). Often, these are on top of full time jobs and/or taking care of dependents at home. Each of these can compound, making degree attainment in practice very difficult.

Additionally, these factors do not impact everyone equally (Fink et al., 2016; Ma \& Baum, 2016). Women are overrepresented in community college demographics, while being underrepresented in bachelors attainment rates (Wang 2015; Surette, 2001). Black and Latine students are respectively 3-5\% and 7-10\% less likely to transfer than their White and Asian peers (Murnane et al., 2022). The students that end up earning a bachelors were also more likely to grow up near a technology hub city, had relatively higher SES, and younger (Jaggars et al., 2016; Valesco et al., 2024). Students between 18-19 had more than double the  bachelors completion rates than students above 25 years of age (19\% and 7\% respectively) (Valesco et al., 2024). A similar disparity exists between high income students and low income students, with high income students also maintaining more than double the success rates than their low income peers (20\% and 9\% respectively) (Valesco et al., 2024; Murnane et al., 2022).

More specifically, a well noted issue within higher education is that many credits fail to transfer from community colleges, requiring transfer students to spend more time and money for the same degree. Nationally, community college transfer students lose an average of 13 credits upon transfer which is equal to a complete semester of schooling (GAO, 2017). To mitigate this loss, Massachusetts' MassTransfer program guarantees many community college degrees transfer fully (60 credits; on its face, four semesters) to participating universities. There are two issues regarding the current scope of MassTransfer. The first is that only 5 of the 10 non-specialized public universities have (any) MassTransfer agreement in computer science, and second is that MassTransfer does not specify \textit{how} the credits transfer. In many cases, a large amount of them transfer as general elective credits, which in practice don't really get a student closer to degree completion. The main limiting factor for students graduation is fulfilling the degree requirements not the total amount of credits (which they generally earn in tandem with the degree and gen-ed requirements anyway). 60 transferable credit hours very rarely translates in-practice to the two years of schooling required to get them.

Additionally, Massachusetts community colleges are only shallowly incentivized to promote transfer. Of the 50\% of funding community colleges get from the state, only 5\% is determined by transfer. Of the funding categories, transfer is the least prioritized success metric of them all (Salomon-Fernandez, 2014). The public four-years within the state also have very little to no incentive to take transfer students from community colleges. There is no state kickback for enrolling more of them, an many of these schools already have competitive applicants who would come in as freshmen. The lack of incentive structure often leaves transfer students holding the bag, as they were promised opportunities upon registration (including credits, information, and support) (Wang 2020, p 153). 

\subsection{Computer Science}

%CS Trends
Computer science as a field is of particular interest to us for all of the reasons community colleges are important to us: its scope, potential for socioeconomic mobility, lack of diversity, and its poor transfer system. From 2017 the amount of computer science graduates has increased by over 51\%, following a wider trend of exponential growth within the major (NCES, 2023; NSC, 2024). At many schools, computer science enrollment is higher than all humanities degrees combined (Anderson, 2023). Of the many degrees a student could choose, computer science (CS) has some of the highest potential to situate students into high paying and stable careers. CS has a lucrative average salary, at about \$90,000 per year compared with the state average of \$56,000 for a bachelors (ZipRecruiter, 2024a; ZipRecruiter, 2024b).

% Diverse
Within CS, the demographic makeup of those in community colleges and professionals is the most disparate of any field (NCSES, 2023). While women make up close to half of most other STEM fields, women still only make up 22.6\% of recent graduates in computer science (IPEDS, 2022). More specifically, within Massachusetts public universities, 10.1\% of graduated male transfer students earned a computer science bachelors compared with a mere 0.7\% of graduated female transfer students. (Valesco et al., 2024).

% Difficult
For all of their potential for social and economic equality, CS degrees are also the pathways with the most institutional barriers. Barriers not merely in the academic content of the degree, but in terms of course articulation, breadth, prerequisite structures, and credit hour minimums (Jaggars et al., 2016). Due to the fields rapidly evolving pace, course content and articulation agreements need to be constantly updated, making transfer guarantees difficult and outdated information prevalent. STEM fields, and CS in particular, are also highly competitive and already have limited capacity for resident students, let alone transfers, additionally making guarantees and even entire transfer paths more unviable than other degrees (Wyner et al., 2016). A Californian longitudinal study found only 1\% of CS community college students followed the traditional "2+2" pathway (Jaggars et al., 2016).


\subsection{Roadmap}
% The Point of Our Paper
In this paper, we aim to analyze the computer science community college transfer landscape within Massachusetts. We chose Massachusetts as our subject mostly because we it call home, but also because it was the most recent state to follow the wave of free community college happening within the United States. Specifically, we analyze the course structures and articulation agreements of all the state's community colleges and all of its public universities to determine the structural barriers in place that impact all students, no matter their life circumstances. We hope that thoroughly analyzing the course structure will shine light on the difference between 60 credits and two years transferring. Any difference between these methods will yield higher cost in both time and money for transfer students, decreasing degree attainment.

\section{Methodology}
Part of our methodology we want to highlight throughout is the structural nature of our research questions. In all ways we can, we assume the omniscient and eager student to send through the each university's CS curriculum. In omniscience, we assume the student knows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item they want to pursue CS from the beginning;
    \item they want to transfer from the beginning;
    \item \textit{where} they want to transfer to from the beginning;
    \item they will be accepted to their four-year of choice;
    \item calc-readiness;
    \item which courses they could take will transfer to their institution;
\end{itemize}
In the eagerness assumption, we assume the student:
\begin{itemize}
    \item is able to handle any amount of CS or math courses in a single semester;
    \item transitions flawlessly into their four-year;
    \item gets into every class they need;
    \item has no work or life conflicts with course times;
    \item does not fail or withdraw from any course;
    \item takes as many courses as possible that double or triple count for other requirements;
    \item chooses the concentrations with the least total courses and prerequisites or the concentrations with the most articulation coverage;
    \item has adequate personal, social, and economic support to focus on their studies;
\end{itemize}

We chose this methodology for two interrelated reasons. First, and most importantly, the structural and institutional barriers are the ones that that the structures and institutions we analyze have the most control. Second, these are also the barriers that affect all students, regardless of personal situation, meaning these changes would have large impacts for many students. Thirdly, assuming imperfection would deeply complicate the methodology beyond the scope of this paper. Choosing which and how much of the above assumptions to give up would be arbitrary. Though obviously no student is the 'perfect' student outlined above, the ways they are imperfect are variant. Part of the difficulty regarding systemic obstacles are that different epistemic, technical, social, and economic barriers all compound on students in myriad ways dependent on their intersectional identities and socioeconomic status. Quantifying these for our purposes would be both reductionist and infeasible.

\subsection{Course Requirement Equivalencies}
We broadly replicate the methodology in a similar project studying transfer in Californian universities (Jiang et al., 2024). For each community college to four-year permutation, we wanted to determine how many courses required for a bachelors of science (BS) in computer science (CS) articulated in transfer.

First, we excluded the two schools that did not offer a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science: Massachusetts College of Art and Design and Massachusetts Maritime Academy. This left ten public four-years to analyze.\footnote{Bridgewater State, Fitchburg State, Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts, Salem State, UMass Amherst, UMass Boston, UMass Dartmouth, UMass Lowell, Westfield State, and Worcester State} All but one of the community colleges offered an AS in computer science.\footnote{excepting Cape Cod Community College, which offers an AA in Computer Science Transfer. We included this degree in our analysis since it clearly fulfills the same role as any other transfer degree: transfer.} Where multiple computer science degrees were offered, we chose the one that would transfer, often simply called an associate's in CS Transfer. All fifteen Massachusetts community colleges were included, creating a total of 150 permutations.

Where a school has a complete articulation agreement with a community college, we manually gathered the data from the agreement itself, found on the \href{https://www.mass.edu/masstransfer/}{Massachusetts Department of Higher Education's MassTransfer}. Looking to MassTransfer first is crucial as many courses do not have direct 1:1 equivalencies. Many schools instead articulate groups of courses. Since only five out the ten universities have (any) MassTransfer articulation agreements in CS, we then turned to each university's official course equivalency software or document to then gather the data.

To compare schools on CS transfer specifically, we excluded general education requirements from collection and analysis, unless they were prerequisites to major requirements, keeping with Jiang et al. (2024). We did include elective courses, required natural science and ethics courses, and all required math courses. When choosing between which elective an ideal student would take, we chose the courses with most options for transfer and the least prerequisites.

For each university, we documented each of the course requirements for their BS's in computer science. For each of those requirements, we determined if each community college offered any course equivalent to it. For example, if a university offered Computer Science I, there would be 15 true or false values corresponding to whether that university could take credit from each of the 15 community colleges for that course. For each community college, we took the percent of true values over the total lower division required courses at the four year. We repeated this for every required course at each of the ten universities.

We then looked at the distribution of each of these courses based on their course codes. We made four groups: computing courses, math courses, natural science courses (including engineering), and humanities courses. For each course, we looked at the 15 possible articulations from the 15 local community colleges. If that community college offered a course that articulated to that course, that permutation was given a score of 1, otherwise 0. For example, if a university offered CS 101, and only 12 community colleges offered courses that could transfer, that course had a score of 12/15. For each four-year, we totaled the points within each category over the maximum possible points for that category (amount of required courses x 15 permutations). We then averaged the fractions for each course category across the all of the four-years. The utility of this methodology is to tell us with which field the issues are. Our hypothesis is that computing courses are substantially less likely to articulate compared with math, science, and humanities courses. One potential limitation of this method is that computer science requires more specific courses since we are looking at computer science degrees. Where a humanities or natural science requirement might have multiple courses that could fulfill the requirement, computer science might want particular courses as part of the core curriculum.

In our analysis, we look at both lower division courses and all courses. We look primarily at lower division courses since these are the courses that are exclusively offered to community college students. The idea of the transfer system is to complete the first two years of schooling at community college and then complete the latter two at a four-year, so it makes sense to compare community college with what would be offered in the first two years of a bachelors degree. We also calculated the total articulations for a complete BS degree, since there were some courses that counted as a junior level course or above.

\subsection{Curricular Complexity}

Our second methodology, also loosely following Jiang et al. (2024), measured the complexity of a 'resident' bachelor's degree at each public four-year compared with a transfer degree from their local community college. By 'resident' we mean that a student attended a university from their freshman to senior year. 

For the transfer side of the degree, we assumed the student would get an associates degree in computer science before transfer. We (slightly) diverge from our assumption of omniscience and eagerness for this section for three reasons. \textit{First}, if a student were to truly maximize credits, they would simply take every course that was a four-year requirement and then transfer, regardless of time. This result would be exactly equal to our first research question, making the methodology redundant. Taking the two methodologies together sharpens the structural contours of  the transfer process. The \textit{second} reason is that community college students are generally better off (Dadgar \& Trimble, 2015)\footnote{The most effecient route would be to take only required courses before transfer, but as a general pathway for students, associates are clear and comprehensive options for the average student} and more likely to pursue an AS (Wyner et al., 2016) than to not get a degree before transfer. 84\% of Massachusetts transfer students with 60 credits or more earned them through completing an associates degree (Murnane et al., 2022). This is likely due to the previously mentioned funding structure and because the AS pathways are clearly marked for students on school websites, lifting an epistemic barrier. \textit{Thirdly} and finally, taking into consideration general education requirements and assuming optimal elective choice, assuming an AS versus maximal transfer credit would not substantially change the student's pathways. We still maintain all other parts of the assumption, including minimal prerequisites, optimal general education pathways, choosing electives that can transfer, and no course failures.

Using this methodology, we decided to limit our scope here to just mapping the universities within 50 miles (driving distance, calculated using Google Maps). We chose proximity as the it is one of the largest contributing factors for transfer (Turley, 2009). 77\% of community college students said physical proximity was important or very important to their transfer decisions (Jabbar et al., 2017). Many community college students are commuters who have work, family obligations, roots, and/or permanent homes making them unlikely to move far away for a bachelor's degree. This is especially true for minoritized students (Turley 2009). Additionally, all universities had at least two community colleges within 50 miles, meaning each was well represented. 

In order to gather data, we used spreadsheet software to track a few different variables, including, but not limited to: course name, course code, course number, credit hours, prerequisites, if it's a community college or four-year course, and if its an elective. This allows us to compare degrees across multiple strata.\footnote{Looking back, it would have been far smarter (though more work) to make a formal database with every single course required for either an AS or BS, with each of these variables filled in. It would allow for much farther reaching conclusions, would be more manipulable with code, and would likely be of incredible use to CS departments in community colleges and four-years alike. We recommend future researchers interested in repeating or expanding our methodology to consider this alternative approach.} Our method was to add both the transfer and resident degree on top of eachother (resulting in 12 semesters of courses) and then deleting courses from the BS that has course equivalents in the AS. If everything articulated, then the degree would return to the traditional 8 semesters. With electives, if one of the possible AS elective courses could articulate to one of the possible elective or required courses at a four year, we considered those equivalent, upholding the eagerness assumption. The metrics we consider are three: curricular complexity, total credit hours, and percent of AS credit hours that articulate. 

To analyze and compare curricular complexity, we used \href{curriculranalytics.org}{curricularanalytics.org}'s web tool to automatically calculate the complexity of a degree path. This calculation takes into consideration the length of prerequisite chains and the amount of courses that have prerequisites within each chain. If there are more required courses, longer prerequisite chains (series of courses that need to follow eachother), and Curricula with higher curricular complexity take longer to complete, have lower graduation rates, and disproportionately affects women (Lionelle et al., 2024). We hypothesize that transfer degrees will be substantially more complex than resident degrees. We excluded Massasoit Community College and Roxbury Community College from our complexity analysis as their websites did not list course prerequisites. We emailed their computer science advising departments, but received no response.

To analyze the total credit hours, we compared the resident degree's base 120 required credit hours to the in practice total for transfer degrees. Many universities' resident general education requirements and degree requirements were shy of the required 120 credits, so we added free electives to the degree until the minimum was met. We then compared the difference between resident degrees and transfer degrees, translating them to semesters and average cost for students. 

Additionally, we measured the percent of the AS degree at each community college that could transfer to each of the colleges within 50 miles driving distance. This metric is importantly different from the total as a few universities have small computer science degrees. For example, UMass Amherst requires 24 general elective credits on top of general education and degree requirements to meet the minimum requirement of 120 credits total. According to the previous metric, 120 credits with a resident degree and 120 credits with a transfer degree on their face look similar without detailing much about the Amherst articulation agreements themselves. Supplementing this is the percent of the associates degree credits that could transfer (again, assuming the student took all the right courses and electives) adds needed context for informed policymaking. 

\subsection{Limitations}
The authors of this paper do not have access to the official advisor-centered resources at any of the schools. Their information is more likely to be up to date and accurate than the public and often unofficial agreements we drew from. \footnote{Where there are inaccuracies due to this, we argue that this is a weakness of the schools we study. The publicly available information that students use to plan their degree should be adequate to understand the curricular requirements.} Additionally, of course, there may be small mistakes in the data-gathering process; either in the content of the curricular structure itself or in inefficiencies of the curricular path. 

To mitigate this knowledge gap, we emailed the curricular maps we created to each of the colleges and universities to their respective advising teams. \textbf{X amount} graciously returned our emails, thankfully, fixing some small errors in our data collection. 

Additionally, this paper does not consider out of state transfer. We are comfortable with this limitation as our focus is specifically on Massachusetts state policy, but further research needs to be done to take into consideration the obstacles (or lack thereof) for students who either transfer into or out of Massachusetts. 

\section{Results}

We would like to reiterate that the results that follow are \textit{best case scenarios}. We assume the ideal student. For policy making, these results ought to be considered in tandem with the material and imperfect life students lead in situ.

\subsection{Course Requirement Equivalencies}

%Something to mind when observing the heatmap is it does not include degree size. 
% Something else to note is there is pretty much no difference when looking at just the first closest and just the second closest. The averge has a difference of just 1 (167.5 vs 166.5)

For lower division courses, the school that articulated the most courses was Fitchburg State with an average of 93\% of courses articulating. The school with the lowest articulation rate was Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts at an average 30\%.\footnote{It is worth noting that MCLA only graduates 8 computer science students per year, perhaps making them uninformative of the broader Massachusetts trends. The second lowest was Westfield State with an average of 44\%.} The average four-year had a rate of 61.4\%. This means that roughly 4 out of 10 lower division courses required for a Massachusetts BS cannot be taken at community college.

Additionally, it should be noted that a disproportionate amount of transferable courses were in fields other than computer science. Between required lower division computing, math, science, and humanities courses, computing had by far the lowest articulation percentage. Computing courses had on average a 45\% coverage rate, while math, science, and humanities courses all had above 75\% (77\%, 92\%, and 82\% respectively). In other words, a student can only 1 in 2 of the CS courses required for a BS in community college.

\subsection{Degree Mapping}

\subsubsection{Curricular Complexity}
We hypothesized that curricular pathways would be substantially more complex in transfer. This hypothesis was less consistent than we expected, but was still informative. We looked at three different metrics: First including general education requirements, second excluding general education requirements, and third including both precalculus and general education requirements. The median complexity of the transfer degrees both including and excluding general education requirements were fairly similar.

Notably, when precalculus was added, the difference in curricular complexity more than doubled. Such a jump shows the fragility the assumed ideal transfer scenario we constructed in our methodology. In other words, if a student fails to maximize course coverage (as most students, in practice, do), their degrees become substantially tougher to complete in a healthy or efficient manner. If a student not only needs to complete precalculus, but happens to fail a course their first time, comes to the degree in their second or third semester, or happens to choose a CS elective that does not transfer, the complexity compounds.

There were two schools that had more complex resident degrees than transfer degrees: Fitchburg State and UMass Dartmouth. Fitchburg State requires 13 general education courses while their local community college, Mount Wachusett Community College, only requires 6. Fitchburg has both a strong agreement with Mount Wachusett and a policy that means that general education requirements attained for an Associate's degree count as all general education requirements for Fitchburg. Since Wachusett has substantially less requirements than Fitchburg, a student would be able to shave off a semester of coursework at Fitchburg if the Associates is done with maximal efficiency. A resident degree at is more complex than transfer degrees, we hypothesize, due to strong articulation agreements and because the local community colleges simply have less prerequisites for the same courses.

    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Median Curricular Complexity per Degree}
    \label{tab:currcomp}
\end{table}

% Interestingly, there were \textbf{NUMBER} transfer degrees that were \textit{less} complex than the resident degree. We hypothesize that the lessening complexity is due to general education requirements. The state of Massachusetts guarantees that all general education requirements must transfer to any public four-year institution, except for a maximum of eight credits (two courses). For example, Fitchburg State requires 13 general education courses while their local community college, Mount Wachusett Community College, only requires 6. The state requires these 6 to be equivalent to 11 of Fitchburg State's, meaning the transfer student is required to spend roughly a semester less time than the student who started at Fitchburg.\footnote{Though not legally required to, Fitchburg assures that all general education requirements are fulfilled by completing an associates degree, meaning, in this example, the 6 courses actually transfer as 13 courses.} Where the amount of general education courses were more comparable, transfer degrees were in general substantially more complex.

\subsubsection{Total Credit Hours}

In analyzing the curriculum between schools, we also determined the minimum amount of credits that would be required for graduation from a community college. We used the same three metrics as curricular complexity (gen eds, no gen eds, and precalculus). The median data are featured in the table below. When excluding general education requirements, no credit hours are lost (both have a difference of 16) showing that all of the added credit hours lie not within the structure of general education, but within the major's. If the usual assumption of 16 credit hours to a semester is applied, this means, at an absolute minimum, the average transfer student is spending an extra (and especially busy) semester at their transfer institution. The national average transfer credit loss, according to the U.S Government Accountability Office, is 13 credit hours (GAO, 2017). Given that an average Massachusetts student could not possibly transfer in CS retain more credits than the national \textit{in-practice} average is alarming, and more than enough reason for stakeholders to pay attention.

\subsubsection{Percent AS}

An average of 70.3\% of associates degree credits transferred, meaning an average of 29.7\% of associates degree credits failed to count. The lowest percentage of associates credit was MCLA at 37.8\%\footnote{The second lowest was UMass Boston, accepting an average of 53.4\% credits.} and the highest percentage was UMass Lowell at 89.3\%. This metric, like the prior metric, included free electives to shore up the minimum 120 credits.

\section{Conclusion}

Given the substantially tougher time transfer students navigating Massachusetts' transfer system, we urge policy changes to CS articulation from all capable parties: The State, Public Universities, and Community Colleges.

At the very least, the 'perfect computer science student' should be guaranteed to graduate in 120 credits or less; it should be \textit{in theory possible} for someone to graduate in four years. Even within other STEM fields, a perfectly organized four years generally earns a degree. Most of the non-CS STEM courses transfered with ease, and very careful thought has been This requires buy in from all parties: community colleges and four-years to come together and design curriculum that mesh well together; four-years to somewhat unify their introductory computer science courses so students at community colleges are not limited to the one university that has the same curriculum as them; the state to properly 

Clear information is crucial for students. Even as researchers who took months to work on this project and were paid to do so, we struggled with understanding many of the details -- both rough and fine -- of transfer. For all schools, requirements ought to be clear, labelled with course codes, prerequisites, and credits. Course equivalency sheet should also be easily legible and hearty with information. For example, MassTransfer's design is informative and clear. 

% At present, there is no incentive for transfer. Community colleges have held the brunt of responsibility for transfer. In conversation with community college computer science chairs within the state, multiple four-years refuse to sit with them to create transferable course materials. Community colleges are often left to do their best to replicate the early curriculum of all local four-years, with very little to no collaboration or input from the four-years. Both community colleges and four-years are responsible for transfer. 

% There are no incentives for transfer. Community colleges have no material incentive to encourage transfer (as paychecks come from AS degree attainments rather than successful transfers), and four-years have no incentive if there are already many students wanting into their school (as is often the case with such a booming degree as computer science). However, this leaves students holding the bag, as they were promised transfer opportunities upon registration (including credits, information, and support) (Wang 2020, p 153).

\section{Introduction}

Community colleges offer pathways to earning an associate's degree and, by way of transfer to a 4-year university, to earn a bachelor's degree.  On average, earning an associate's degree increases lifetime earnings by \$450,000 (Carnevale et al., 2024) and earning a bachelor's degree increases lifetime earnings by \$1,000,000 (Carnevale et al., 2024; BLS, 2024). Because students pay less money per credit at community college than at four-year universities, starting at community college creates a strong value proposition. Indeed, community colleges serve a more economically diverse student population compared to universities offering bachelor's degrees \cite{(Murnane et al., 2022; Fink et al., 2016)}.  

However, higher education in the US is currently failing at providing viable transfer pathways from associate's degrees to a bachelor's degree.  Nationally, 81\% of students begin community college with the intention to transfer, but only 33\% transfer within 6 years, and just 14\% complete a bachelor's degree \cite{(Fink, 2024)}. A host of factors and obstacles contribute to the low completion rate. Challenges include but are not limited to: affordability of the four-year institution, insufficient and/or inconsistent advising supports, opaque transfer pathways, lack of alignment between class offerings and students' work schedules and/or family obligations, low articulation between the two institutions, and so-called "transfer shock" when students arrive at the four-year institution \cite{(Lakin and Elliott, 2016)}. Students often face many of these obstacles at once, meaning that the factors compound and make bachelor's attainment difficult to achieve.

% Unequal Burdens
However, these challenges do not impact all students equally \cite{(Fink et al., 2016; Ma \& Baum, 2016)}. For example, women are overrepresented in community college enrollment, but underrepresented in the proportion of transfer students who earn a bachelor's \cite{(Wang 2015; Surette, 2001)}.  Students who earn a bachelor's are also more likely to be younger, come from families with higher incomes, and grow up near a technology hub city than their peers \cite{(Fink et al., 2016; Fink 2024)}. For example, students between the ages of 18-19 had more than double the bachelor's completion rates of students 25+ years old (19\% and 7\% respectively) \cite{(Fink, 2024)}. Higher income transfer students were also more than twice as likely to earn the degree than their low-income peers (20\% and 9\% respectively) \cite{(Fink, 2024; Murnane et al., 2022)}.  A particularly thorny issue regarding transfer is the high rate of credits that fail to transfer from the community college to the four-year. These "lost" credits necessarily mean that transfer students have to spend more time to finish the bachelor's degree as compared with their non-transfer peers. Nationally, community college transfer students lose an average of 13 credits upon transfer, which translates to a full semester of schooling \cite{(GAO, 2017)}. 

Nationally, 43\% percent of first generation students, 50\% of all Hispanic students, and 52\% of Black students are community college educated \cite{(Lyon and Denner, 2016)}. Further, 50\% of women who earn a degree in science, technology, engineering, or math (STEM) are community college-educated \cite{(Lyon and Denner, 2016)} and 20\% of community colleges students report living with a disability \cite{NEED CITATION}.  Research indicates that the more diverse student body at community colleges allows individuals from historically marginalized populations to more freely explore and pursue fields traditionally dominated by White men \cite{(Lyon \& Denner, 2016)}.

The failure of transfer pathways is particularly acute in the field of computer science (CS). Given that computing offers both high job demand and high wages, it is important that to address the low rates of transfer to these degrees.\footnote{The average starting salary for a CS graduate in Massachusetts was \$91,000 per year, compared with \$56,000 for a bachelor's earner overall \cite{(ZipRecruiter, 2024a; ZipRecruiter, 2024b)}.} Despite the potential for economic mobility that a CS degree has to offer, transfer pathways to four year CS degrees have a spectacularly low four-year degree completion rate. A Californian longitudinal study found that only 1\% of community college students earning BS in CS degrees followed the ideal "2+2" pathway \cite{(Fink et al., 2016)}. This lower completion rate is due to the addition of challenges that are idiosyncratic to the computing discipline. These challenges relate to the academic content of degrees, course articulation, prerequisite structures, and credit hour minimums \cite{(Fink et al., 2016)}. Further, due to the field's rapid pace of change, course content and articulation agreements need to be regularly updated, meaning publicly available information is often old and transfer guarantees difficult to realize. Because CS degrees are highly popular with students and "seats" (whether in the major or just in a given class) can be hard to secure, many four-year institutions have little incentive to address these barriers because they feel they are struggling to serve the students they already have \cite{(Wyner et al., 2016)}. 

In this paper, we analyze the CS community college transfer landscape across public higher education institutions in the state of Massachusetts (MA). We chose MA because it is where the authors are located and where we have direct experience, but also because the state recently joined the wave of legislation nationally that seeks to promote tuition-free community college. Inspired by the new MA laws we wanted to understand the potential to grow the pipeline of community college students who transfer to four-year degree-granting institutions and earn a degree in computer science.  Our overarching question is: \textit{From a structural perspective, how hard is it to transfer from a community college to a public four-year institution and earn a degree in computer science in the state of Massachusetts?} To answer that question, we analyze the course structures and articulation agreements of all the state's community colleges and universities to identify the structural barriers that could stand in the way of a student being able to pursue and complete a CS degree. 

This paper makes several contributions. First, we analyze the CS articulation agreements for every combination of community college and four-year university. We visualized these data in a heat map that quantifies the percentage of transferrable courses for each combination in the state of Massachusetts. We call this step "BS in CS Lower Division Course Equivalency Mapping." We chose this methodology to start as it was the broadest scope of analysis and provided a good understanding of the general transfer landscape in Massachusetts. In other words, our project of Course Equivalency Mapping answers the question "What percent of lower division courses of the BS in CS at each university can be taken at Massachusetts community colleges?". 

Second, building on the work of Jiang et al. \cite{(2024)}, we wanted to compare the degree complexity of the available transfer pathways. We call this "Degree Complexity Analysis." This methodology seeks to answer the question, "How difficult is it to earn a "transfer BS in CS" degree compared to a "resident BS in CS"?". Note, that we define difficulty not in terms of course content (we hope that all courses are rigorous and challenging), but in terms of the degree's structure, considering pre-requisites, co-requisites, etc. After building out the transfer degree, we compare the two degrees along the lines of complexity \cite{(Heilman et al., 2018)}.

Third, we continue to use the transfer pathways built for the second methodology to compare the resident and transfer pathways in terms of credit hours. The question this method will answer is "How much more/less time would a transfer AS in BS take than a resident AS in BS?". We call this process "Time-to-Degree Analysis."

We conclude with limitations of the work and future work.  

\section{Community College in Massachusetts}

In 2022, 112,000 students were enrolled in community colleges in Massachusetts (MA). These students represented 46\% of total undergraduate enrollment in the state \cite{(MACC, 2024)}. In MA, of public, four-year transfer students, Black and Hispanic students each made up 21\% of the total, compared to just White and Asian students each making up 13\% \cite{(Fink, 2024)}.  A longitudinal study by \cite{Murnane et al. (2022)} found that in MA, Black/African American and Latine students are respectively 3\% and 7\% less likely to transfer than their White and Asian peers.

Through \href{https://www.mass.gov/info-details/free-community-college}{MassEducate}, which was written into the state's budget in 2024, MA covers 100\% of community college tuition for any resident without a prior degree. The ambitious hope of this policy is to create an educational pathway to careers and higher earnings available to a wider array of learners in the state. 

Supporting this effort is MassTransfer, which, among other things, lays out the associate's to bachelor's (A2B) pathways that have been mapped between specific community colleges and four-year degree granting institutions and that guarantee a transfer of 60 credits. Appreciating that the program is new and still in development, we note that MassTransfer does not yet specify \textit{how} the credits transfer. In many cases, a large number of the credits transfer to the four-year as general elective credits, which do not get a student closer to degree completion in a field like CS. Indeed, the main limiting factor preventing transfer students from graduating is fulfilling the \textit{CS degree} requirements not the total number of credits (which students tend to earn as a matter of course as they complete the degree and gen-ed requirements). In other words, "60 transferable credit hours" rarely means a student can earn a degree in just two more years after completing their AS in CS.

% No Transfer Incentives
Further complicating this landscape is the state's funding model; specifically, the fact that, in MA, community colleges have only a slight financial incentive to promote transfer. Of the funding that community colleges receive from the state, only 5\% is determined by transfer. Indeed, of the metrics that determine the level of funding, transfer is the smallest and therefore likely to be the least prioritized \cite{(Salomon-Fernandez, 2014)}. Similarly, unless a public four-year state institution is struggling with enrollments, there is little incentive to admit transfer students. Lack of incentive alignment often leaves transfer students holding the bag, feeling they were promised opportunities upon registration (including credits, information, and support) but facing the reality that the road ahead is much more complicated and daunting than they had initially realized \cite{(Wang 2020, p 153)}. 

%I DONT THINK WE NEED THIS: ...However, while CS offers significant economic prospects to degree earners, the demographics of CS graduates differ dramatically from those of graduates overall (NCES, 2023). In 2023, women made up of 52.4\% of graduates in STEM fields, but only 23.4\% of graduates in computer science (IPEDS, 2023). Similarly, while women are over represented in terms of community college enrollments in Massachusetts, 10.1\% of male transfer students earned a computer science bachelors compared to a mere 0.7\% of female transfer students. (Fink, 2024).

\section{Methodological Assumptions}
\label{sec:assumptions}

Because students are all different and the peculiarities of life circumstances infinite, we made a series of leveling assumptions in order to be able to compare transfer pathways across different community college--four-year combinations. We summarize these assumptions into the concept of the "omniscient and undeterrable student," i.e., the student who knows what they want to do from day one and is set up to pursue the designed pathway without pauses or detours.

In terms of omniscience, we assume that the student:
\begin{itemize}
    \item knows they want to pursue CS from the first day at community college;
    \item knows that they want to transfer from the first day of community college;
    \item knows \textit{where} they want to transfer to from the first day of community college;
    \item is sure they will be accepted to the four-year institution of their choice;
    \item is calculus-ready; and
    \item knows which courses transfer to the destination institution.
\end{itemize}

In terms of undeterrance, we assume that the student:
\begin{itemize}
    \item is prepared to take college-level courses in all subjects; \footnote{Nearly  60\% of incoming community college students are not \cite{(Bailey, 2009)}.}
    \item is able to handle up to four CS and/or math courses in a single semester;
    \item avoids "transfer shock" after they arrive at their destination;
    \item gets into every class they need;
    \item has no work or life conflicts with course times;
    \item does not fail or withdraw from any course;
    \item optimizes on the number of courses that double or triple count for other requirements; and
    \item has adequate personal, social, and economic support to focus on their studies.
\end{itemize}

We acknowledge that this student both does not exist and also that it is far from the reality of community college students who are regularly juggling significant home and work responsibilities on top of their academics. That said, this approach creates a \textbf{best-case scenario} and creates a uniform basis for comparison.  We also chose this methodology because it allows us to center on the institution and the barriers that can be identified and removed, rather than centering on any perceived "deficits" or "shortcomings" of the student. The "omniscient and undeterrable" student approach also allows us to identify barriers that would affect the vast majority of students, regardless of the specifics of any given student's personal situation. Finally, we note that assuming "imperfection" would vastly complicate the methodology and require arbitrary assumptions as to the nature of the imperfections. Though obviously no student is perfect, the ways in which they are imperfect vary -- involving epistemic, technical, social, and economic challenges that compound on students in myriad ways dependent on their intersectional identities and socioeconomic status. With these assumptions we now explore how even a best-case scenario does not remove the curricular barriers facing students who start in community college and wish to complete the BS in CS.  

\section{1. Lower Division Course Requirement Equivalencies}
\label{sec:course-reqs}

\subsection{Methodology}
We broadly replicate the methodology used in a study of CS transfer pathways in California state universities \cite{(Jiang et al., 2024)}. Similar to Jiang et al. (2024), our first goal was to determine how many courses required for the BS in CS articulate for each community college to four-year pathway combination in MA.

MA has 13 universities that offer bachelor's degrees and 15 community colleges that offer the associate's degree.\footnote{None of the MA community colleges offer a bachelor's degree.}  We excluded the two universities that do not offer the BS in CS,\footnote{Massachusetts College of Art and Design and Massachusetts Maritime Academy.} leaving us with 11 public, four-year, degree-granting institutions to analyze.\footnote{Bridgewater State, Fitchburg State, Framingham State, Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts, Salem State, University of Massachusetts Amherst, University of Massachusetts Boston, University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, University of Massachusetts Lowell, Westfield State, and Worcester State} 

All but one of the community colleges offers an Associate's of Science in Computer Science (AS in CS). The one institution that does not offer the AS in CS does offer an Associate's of Arts in CS and we include that degree in our analysis. Where multiple AS in CS degrees were offered, we chose the one that would transfer most easily, often choosing the degree that is labeled as the "Associate's in CS Transfer." Where multiple concentrations were available, we chose the most general one, often simply called "general computer science" As such, all 15 Massachusetts community colleges\footnote{LIST ALL OF THEM HERE IN THIS FOOTNOTE LIKE YOU DID FOR 4-YEARS.} were included in the analysis, resulting in a total of 165 pathway pairs.

The Massachusetts Department of Higher Education's MassTransfer program contains multiple databases important for understanding articulation within Massachusetts. The first and most comprehensive is the A2B Transfer Database, which has full degree pathways for CS transfer students in a specific community college and going to a specific four-year. Where we could, we manually pulled data from these comprehensive "2+2" pathways. Looking to MassTransfer first is crucial as many courses do not have direct 1:1 equivalencies. Instead, many schools articulate groups of CS courses as "blocks" where, though no one course in community college is equivalent to a single course in the four-year university,  five courses could be equivalent to another five. The limit of this database is that only 5 of the 11 four-year universities had \textit{any} "2+2" pathways in the database. Where there was not a complete agreement, we used MassTransfer's course equivalency database as well as the individual university course equivalency databases to pull the non-2+2 permutations. 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{All Existing MassTransfer Articulation Agreements in CS.png}
    \caption{Is this image worth keeping?}
    \label{fig:MT}
\end{figure}

%For combinations where the four-year and the community college have a complete articulation agreement that has been registered into MassTransfer's online database located on \href{https://www.mass.edu/masstransfer/}{the Massachusetts Department of Higher Education website}, we manually pulled the data from the agreement.  In doing this, we found that only 5 of the 11 four-year institutions had any MassTransfer articulation agreements with a community college. For the permutations that lacked full agreements, we turned to each university's course equivalency database and the MassTransfer course equivalency database to gather the remaining course data. Even though many schools didn't have full agreements with four-years in MassTransfer, the MassTransfer equivalency database and university databases together provide a complete of the individual course equivalencies within the state.

In our analysis, our emphasis was on lower division courses (courses taken in the first two years of a four-year degree) given that these are the courses that are typically available to students in community colleges. Because, for students with intent to transfer, a common approach is to complete the first two years of schooling at community college and the latter two at a the four-year (a "2+2 degree"), it makes sense to compare what classes can be taken in community college with those that are required in the first two years of a bachelors degree. We defined "lower division" as any course at the 100 or 200 level. \footnote{While the first two years was our focus, we also collected data the total articulations for a complete BS in CS. Thus, in tandem with our analysis of lower division courses, we also analyzed the articulations with the entire degree since there were some courses that counted as a junior level course or above. We did not include the full degree in our final analysis since the results were not substantially distinct from the lower division courses. Overall,  lower division courses that articulated as upper level courses were fairly anomalous.}

For each university, we identified all of the course requirements for the BS in CS. Then, for each required course, we determined whether there was an equivalent course at each community college.  We repeated this approach for every required course at each of the eleven universities and all of the community colleges. Then for each pair, we computed the "transfer credit percentage" as the total number of required courses that articulate divided by the total number of courses required for the required lower-division courses at the four-year university.  It is important to note here that out categorization was binary. A course either articulated or did not. Therefore, in cases where a four credit course articulated as a three credit equivalent, it was still considered fully equivalent.  

We also looked at the distribution of each of the courses based on their course codes, dividing courses up into four groups: computing, math, natural science (including engineering), and humanities. For each course, we looked at the possible articulations from the 15 local community colleges. We repeat here the same methodology as above, but instead of counting the percentage of courses that transfer from community colleges (along the rows), we calculate the percentage of community colleges that have an equivalent course for one particular course (along the columns). We add up the total 'true' values for each course, then within each group of courses to get the rate of articulation for a particular field. Our hypothesis is that computing courses would be less likely to articulate as compared with math, science, and humanities courses. One limitation of this method is that a CS degree requires specific CS courses. Where, for example, a natural science requirement could be fulfilled by physics, chemistry, or biology courses, often computer science will want particular courses to fulfill the core curriculum.

\subsection{Results}
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{pct of Lower Division Required CS Courses that Articulate From Community Colleges.png}
    \caption{Massachusetts articulation heat-map for the first two years of computer science degree requirements.}
    \label{fig:heatmap}
\end{figure}

We show the results in Figure \ref{fig:heatmap} as a heat map where the rows are the community colleges and the columns are the four-year universities.  Each cell in the heat map represents the percentage of classes in the community college that satisfy lower-division requirements for the BS in CS -- we call this the "articulation coverage".\footnote{Recall that our analysis excludes general education requirements.}  For example, students transferring with an AS in CS from Berkshire Community College to Bridgewater State will have 55\% of the required lower-division classes accepted.  This means that 45\% of the courses required for the CS degree that would typically be taken in the first two years at Bridgewater still need to be completed.  Across all 165 pairs, we observed an average articulation coverage of 61.4\%.  In practice, this means that only slightly more than two semesters worth of courses required for the CS degree at the four-year university will have been completed.  In the next section, we translate these coverage percentages into time-to-degree.   

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{images/field_distribution.png}
    \caption{Distribution of Articulated Courses}
    \label{fig:distribution}
\end{figure}

With respect to \textit{which} required courses were included in the articulation agreements, our analysis showed that a most were in fields \textit{other than} computer science. In other words, most of the articulation is happening for required, lower division math, science, and humanities courses, and not in for computing. On average, the articulation agreements covered just 45\% of the required computing courses, compared to 77\%, 92\%, and 82\% for math, science, and humanities respectively. This means that, on average, less than half of the required computing courses for a BS are unable to be taken at community college.

Across the field of computer science, there is a lack of consistency even in the introductory sequence, making articulation agreements difficult to scale and replicate.\footnote{Massachusets does not require that all universities use the same programming language or have the same course numbering.} In many cases, core CS courses such as Computer Science I or Data Structures did not articulate from community colleges but math courses such as Calculus I or Linear Algebra did. One explanation of this phenomenon is that, unlike mathematics for example, there is a variety of disagreements over what belongs in an introductory course. Variations lie in programming languages, the level of prior knowledge expected, and the concepts themselves. Though there may be variations between teachers, the Calculus I learning outcomes are largely settled. Another factor may be that a specific community college's curriculum may be tailored to a specific (closest) four-year and thus not articulate well to other four-year universities in the state. We can gut check this hypothesis, looking across the rows of the heat map and thinking about geographic proximity. For example, Middlesex Community College is geographically close to the University of Massachusetts (UMass) Lowell, and geographically far away from UMass Amherst and the articulation coverage percentages at these two universities are 95\% and 71\%, respectively.  

Also of note is that four-year universities stay consistently within a range of $\pm$ 20\%  from the average between community colleges (see the columns in the figure). A possible explanation may be that the quality (real or perceived) or willingness of the four-year university has more to do with expansive transfer agreements than the quality of community college courses. This explanation would lead us to conclude that, even as community colleges work to align their curricula with their closest four-year institutions, their courses may not articulate for reasons other than quality or content. As previously mentioned, we speculate that some four-year universities view (especially computer science) transfer students as low priority due to a simultaneous high demand of first years - first years who will pay for four years of schooling, not just two. It can also be the case that faculty are reluctant to receive transfer students into their classrooms out of a perception that community college students have inferior educational credentials and are not set up to handle the "rigor" of the four year. Additionally, the rapid development of computer science pedagogy may make keeping up with curricular updates uniquely difficult at community colleges which tend to be less well-resourced than four-year universities \cite{NEED A CITATION FOR THIS STATEMENT}.

\section{2. Comparison of Transfer and Resident Pathways to the BS in CS}

Our second analysis, also inspired by Jiang et al. (2024), compares the curriculum of the "resident" (i.e., non-transfer) and the "transfer-pathway" students. We analyze the differences in the two pathways with respect to their degree complexity \cite{}, total credit hours to complete the BS in CS, and percentage of AS credit hours that articulate between the community college and the four-year university. 
 
For the "transfer pathway" student, we assumed they would earn their AS in CS before transferring.  We made this assumption because it is generally more financially prudent for community college students to finish an AS before transfer \cite{(Dadgar and Trimble, 2015)} and that students are more likely to complete their AS before transferring  \cite{(Wyner et al., 2016)}. For example, 84\% of transfer students in MA with 60+ credits earned them as part of completing an AS \cite{(Murnane et al., 2022)}.\footnote{If on the other hand, as we assume in \ref{sec:course-reqs} that students maximize transferable credits from community college, then they would take every course that articulates to the four-year university and transfer without necessarily earning their associate's.} Although our new assumption that students complete the AS before transfer differs from our methodology in Section \ref{sec:course-reqs}, we retain all other assumptions about our "ideal" transfer student listed in Section \ref{sec:assumptions}.  

We limited our analysis of each four-year university to examine the transfer pathway for students from community colleges within 50 miles\footnote{Calculated as driving distance based on \href{https://www.google.com/maps}{Google Maps}.} of the four-year institution because of the priority transfer students place on geographic proximity \cite{Turley, 2009}. According to Jabbar et al. \cite{(2016)}, 77\% of community college students reported that physical proximity was "important" or "very important" to their transfer decision.  This is especially true for students from populations historically marginalized in higher ed \cite{Turley, 2009)}. Note that each of the four-year universities has 2 or more community colleges within 50 miles. 

To compare degree complexity, we layered the resident and transfer degrees on top of each other (resulting in 12 semesters of courses - four at the community college and eight at the four-year). To calculate differences between the resident and transfer pathways, we first mapped the BS in CS degree for each four-year university for students who start in their first year (i.e., resident students).  We do the same for the AS degree. Then we overlap the map for the AS onto the map for the BS and delete nodes in the BS that have an equivalent course in the AS. For example, if Calculus I was required for both the AS and BS, then we would replace the course in the BS with the course in the AS - along with its course codes, prerequisites, and transferable credit hours. In the case of electives, if one of the possible AS electives could articulate to one of the possible BS electives or required courses, we considered those equivalent and replaced it on the curricular map. 
  
\subsection{Curricular Complexity}

We used \href{curriculranalytics.org}{Curricular Analytics} to calculate the complexity of both degree paths \cite{(Heilman et al., 2018)}. This calculation takes into consideration the length of prerequisite chains and the pre- and co-requisites within each chain. If there are more required courses, longer prerequisite chains, and courses that gate-keep courses that follow, the complexity of the degree increases. Pathways with higher complexity take longer to complete, have lower graduation rates \cite{(Hoopes, 2022)}, and lower representations of women \cite{(Lionelle et al., 2024)}. We hypothesized that transfer degrees would be more complex than resident degrees.\footnote{Note that, for this portion of the methodology, we excluded Massasoit Community College and Roxbury Community College as their websites did not list course prerequisites. We attempted to communicate with the computer science advising departments at both institutions, but received no response.}  

\begin{table}[]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
       & Incl. Gen Eds & Excl. Gen Eds & Incl. Precalc\\
       4 Year   & 157.0 & 145.0 & 167.0 \\
       Transfer & 167.5 & 153.5 & 188.5 \\ 
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Average Curricular Complexity}
    \label{tab:currcomp}
\end{table}


We show the results in Table \ref{tab:currcomp}, with three different versions: 1) average degree complexity with general education requirements; 2) average degree complexity without general education requirements; and 3) average degree complexity with general education requirements \textit{and} pre-calculus (which, we recognize is a deviation from the assumption of the student being calculus-ready, as described in Section \ref{sec:assumptions}).

We want to reiterate here that this portion of our analysis is limited to community colleges located within 50 miles of each four-year institution, meaning we don't have the same quantity of data we did in the prior section. We also note that, in choosing geographically close pairings, this approach is likely to yield more favorable results than if we were to compare degrees regardless of proximity, the rationale being that four-year institutions have more incentive to invest in articulated pathways with those nearby institutions that send them the most students.

In doing this part of our research, we hypothesized that curricular pathways would be more complex for the transfer pathway than for the resident degree. While, as shown in Table X, overall this hypothesis proved correct and there is a slight correlation between transfer pathway and complexity. However, the results were less stark than we anticipated. At the high end, the greatest difference in complexity was 54 we see a difference of  -24, meaning the transfer degree was 24 points \textit{less complex} than the resident degree. More interestingly though, this wide range across complexity scores without outliers shows a stunning lack of consistency in how community college students transfer into the different public universities. That said, degree complexity may not contain a strong enough correlation for state-wide policy; the issue doesn't seem to be here. Likely though, a complexity analysis will still be a useful piece of analysis at the level of individual institutions considering that many curricula's complexity scores are so substantial.

As expected, when pre-calculus was added, the difference in degree complexity increased.  

There were three schools where the resident degrees were {more complex} than their transfer-pathway degrees: Bridgewater State, Fitchburg State, and University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. We have a few hypotheses as to why this is. First, we believe it is due to the number of general education courses. Using Fitchburg State as an example: the university requires 13 general education courses whereas their local community college, Mount Wachusett Community College, only requires six. Fitchburg has both a strong agreement with Mount Wachusett and a policy whereby all of the general education requirements attained for an AS count toward the general education requirements at Fitchburg. Since Mount Wachusett has substantially fewer requirements than Fitchburg, a student would actually be able to shave off a semester of coursework at Fitchburg if the associate's is earned with maximal efficiency. Second, community colleges in general have fewer prerequisites for their courses. For example, the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth requires Physics I and Calculus II be taken before Physics II, but at Cape Cod Community College the prerequisites for Physics II are limited to high school math and Physics I. Similar differences in the prerequisites of early computing courses also exist. These difference in structure and sequencing can add up and result in a less complex curriculum as compared to the resident pathway.  However, without strong articulation agreements, the complexity of added classes would in general outweigh these idiosyncrasies.

%\end{figure}

\subsection{Total Credit Hours}
\label{sec:total-ch}

To analyze the total credit hours, we compared the resident degree's base 120 required credit hours to the total for the transfer pathway degrees. 
%OMIT -- as its not important, since the resident dgree has to be 120: To make an apples to apples comparison, because many universities' resident general education requirements and degree requirements for CS were shy of the required 120 credits, so we added free electives to the degree to reach the 120 hours. 
On average, transfer pathway students need to complete 135 credits to complete the BS in CS -- 15 more than resident students. Additional credit hours for transfer pathway students ranged from 3 to 33 credits.  Under the assumption that a student takes 15 credit hours per semester, this means that on average, a transfer student is spending one extra semester in school to complete their BS in CS. And this is for the "omniscient and undeterrable" student so in practice the extra time to completion is likely two or three additional semesters. The national average transfer credit loss across all degrees, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, is 13 credit hours \cite{GAO, 2017}. It is important to recognize that the GAO's analysis examines students in situ, i.e., versus our assumptions of "omniscience and undeterrance." 

\subsection{Transfer Percentage of the AS}

Finally, we measured the \textit{percentage} of the AS degree at each community college that could transfer to each of the universities within the 50 mile driving radius. This metric is different from the added required credit hours as some of the 11 universities have computer science degrees with very few required courses. For example, to meet the requirement of 120 credits, a university might have unrestricted elective credits on top of general education and degree requirements. Indeed, 120 credits for a resident degree and 120 credits for a transfer degree could look, on the surface, similar but, in reality, the number of courses that equate to general education or degree requirements could be small. Rather, many CS courses could transfer merely as general credits that would only serve to get them to 120 credits. There are two situations in which transfer-pathways add very few additional credits:  1) because of good articulation agreements; or 2) because the CS degree requirements are "light."  

On average, 67.6\% of AS credits transfer to satisfy the CS degree requirements at the proximate four-years. In other words, in the case of these pairings, 32.4\% of AS credits \textit{fail to transfer to the school that are geographically closest to the community college}. The lowest average associate's credit acceptance rate was 37.8\% and the highest was 89.3\%. The university at the high end accepted 100\% of AS credits from five out of seven of their local community colleges. Five out of the ten four-year schools had at least one community college that had 100\% articulation. 

Importantly, the university with the lowest average credit hours added to the degree was only very slightly above average in terms of AS articulation as a percent. This is likely because this university's general education and CS major requirements only totaled 97 credit hours, while the university still required 120 credit hours to earn the degree. This means that the student would need to take 23 credits of free electives. When adding the AS to this BS then, a lot of the courses that did not articulate to any general education or major requirements merely transferred as credit hours. These were not counted as part of the AS that articulated to requirements, but also did not add any extra credit hours, creating the disparity shown in the table. A similar phenomenon occurred for universities with the second to least extra credit hours: they both have AS articulation percentages close to or below the average. This fact ought to make the results of Section \ref{sec:total-ch}) even more alarming, as many of the more promising results have the buffer of credit hour minimums preventing the results from being far worse. The average added credit hours would likely be far higher. In other words, their success is not due to good articulation agreements in computer science, but rather because they happen to have a small computer science degree.

\section{Limitations}

For the purposes of our analysis, we were limited to the use of public-facing information, whether in MassTransfer or on the web sites of the respective institutions. We did not have access to any internal advising resources but appreciate and indeed assume that the information advisors share with students might be more up to date. We argue that this weakness in our methodology in fact speaks to the difficulty that students seeking to transfer face on a daily basis and that publicly available information should be adequate for students to understand the curricular requirements and plan their degree. 

To mitigate potential errors, we sent the curricular maps created to each of the colleges and universities over email to either an advisor or faculty member. \textbf{X amount} graciously returned our emails, thankfully, fixing some small errors in our data collection. 

Of course, despite our the validation steps, we are sensitive to the possibility of misinterpreting the publicly available data either in inefficiencies of the curricular path or in the content of the curricular structure. For example, there may be more courses that double count for general education requirements or more alternative courses that had less prerequisites than we noticed. 

There are two limitations in scope: space and time. First, this paper does not consider out of state transfer. We are comfortable with this limitation as our focus is specifically on Massachusetts state policy, but we emphasize that further research needs to be done to take into consideration the obstacles (or lack thereof) for students who either transfer into or out of Massachusetts. Additionally, we only took the most recent (2024) course data, which does not consider past course offerings and, of course, may change in the future. University offerings and requirements, especially in CS, change frequently and the analysis shared here is only a snapshot in time. 

\section{Conclusion}

Given the substantially longer time transfer students spend navigating Massachusetts' transfer system, we urge policy changes to CS articulation from all capable parties: The State, Public Universities, and Community Colleges.

At the very least, the 'perfect computer science student' should be guaranteed to graduate in 120 credits or less; it should be \textit{in theory possible} for someone to graduate in four years on the transfer pathway. 

This will require buy-in from all parties: community colleges and four-years to come together and design curriculum that mesh well together; four-years to somewhat unify their introductory computer science courses so students at community colleges are not limited to the one university that has the same curriculum as them.

Clear information is crucial for students. Even as researchers who took months to work on this project, we struggled with understanding many of the details -- both rough and fine -- of transfer. For all schools, requirements ought to be clear, labeled with course codes, prerequisites, and credits. Course equivalency sheets should also be easily legible and hearty with information. For example, MassTransfer's design is informative and clear, but not all universities use MassTransfer's website. 

Finally, our analysis was for a student finding the optimal pathway, in the future we we would like to study how far reality sits from this ideal.

We would like to thank all of the representatives from community colleges, universities, and the Department of Higher Education that so graciously offered their time and wisdom to help us better understand the unique and personal barriers that cannot be captured in data.
