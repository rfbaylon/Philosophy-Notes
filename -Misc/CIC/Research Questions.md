### Transfer Access
- What are the (course scale) limiting factors for more articulation agreements?
	- What are the courses that are least likely to be articulated? (Q: Did the UCSD paper get data on each of the courses or just % articulation of each course?)
- Which of these factors are the most tractable?
- What are the characteristics of community colleges and universities with low articulation rates?

Articulation rate = articulated math + articulated cs / required math + required cs

Proposal:
Manual trawl MassTransfer to find:
| Community College | 4 Year | Total required math courses (count) | Covered Math Courses | Total required CS courses (count) | Covered CS Courses |
\
### Outcomes
- Do transfer students do comparably well as 4y direct students? (grade analysis along transfer vs nontransfer students)
	- if not, why not?
- What features do the transfer successful students have?
	- IE, what can we say about a student with an average of a B or higher that we cant about a C or lower student

Proposal:
- Use CIC partner data to track grades against transfer/non-transfer students
	- Just from tableau, 81.57% of CS majors passed and 75.48% of transfer students passed.
	- 11.06% of CS majors failed and 14.05% of transfer students failed
	- Notably, transfer students are doing better than "other computing" majors across the board
- Use access to UCSD database in order to track grades across students
