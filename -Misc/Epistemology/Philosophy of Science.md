What does it mean for a proposition to be true?

# Correspondence Theory
A flavor of scientific realism

## A2 Correspondence Theory

### Too Abstract
Correspondence theory is abstract and fails to capture the reasons people on the ground care about truth. The correspondence theorist needs to rest on abstract principles (which may be thin at best) for why we ought to care about the truth. The pragmatist builds the theory of truth from the ground up, avoiding this issue. It simply *asks* people why they care.
	[[Pragmatism and Other Writings]] 34-35

### Duties to Agree are Contextual
Some truths are irrelevant some times and others need to be brought to the fore. You may have a duty to ignore capital T 'Truths' depending on social circumstances to make your life go better. Truth is mixed in a web of concrete expediencies which may or may not bring it to the fore.
	[[Pragmatism and Other Writings]] 102

# Coherence Theory
A flavor of scientific anti-realism
Something is true insofar as it coheres with our best (?) picture of the world.

### Peirce
Something along the lines of "Something is true if a group of ideal researchers given good motive and infinite time would agree on a statement"

### James
[[James]], [[Dewey]]
We are incredibly conservative in our beliefs -- we want them to change as little as possible. When we confront something that doesnt cohere with our picture, we immediately want to reject it. If we can't reject it, we do everything we can to make it cohere with our other beliefs with minimal distrubance. 
	[[Pragmatism and Other Writings]] 31

Our knowledge grows in spots, like continual coffee stains on a napkin. The coffee stains spread, but we want them to spread as little as possible as to not disturb other beliefs. "We patch and tinker more than we renew"
	[[Pragmatism and Other Writings]] 75

Our "common sense" are the brute facts we get from being human. Its the common construction of our bodies in a common environment that makes "common sense" common. Were we constructed differently, we would have far different modes of understanding our experiences. Common things include: permanence, kind, causal influence, and modality. (Beginnings of [[Standpoint Epistemology]]
	[[Pragmatism and Other Writings]] 76
# Pragmatism
[[Peirce]], [[James]]
What is true is what leads to a life well lived.
Additionally, this view is mutually inclusive with a few different theories of truth. The only thing that Pragmatism wants to do is put constraints on what a good answer looks like. For example, "Truth is the system of propositions which havve an unconditional claim to be recognized as valid" -- the pragmatist could say of course! Yes! But what is the cash value of such a definition? What do you mean by claim? Duty? How can our defining of these terms lead to better lives?
	[[Pragmatism and Other Writings]] 100

Perhaps a bit [[Plato]]nic: What is beautiful is what is true. See also [[Murdoch]]?

Beliefs are really rules for action. To develoip a thoughts emaning we need only to determine what conduct it is fitted to produce: that conduct is for us its sole significance.

"In waht respects would the world be different if this alternative or that were true? If I can find nothing that would become different, then the alternative has no sense"
	[[Pragmatism and Other Writings]] 26

"The attitude of looking away from first things, principles, categories, supposed necessities; and of looking towards last things, fruits, consequences, facts"
	[[Pragmatism and Other Writings]] 29

"The truth of an idea is not a stagnant property in herent in it. Trith *happens* to an idea. It *becomes* true, is *made* true by events"
	[[Pragmatism and Other Writings]] 88

But may not our descriptions be themselves important additions to reality? And may not previous reality itself be there, far less for the purpose of reappearing unaltered in our knowledge than for the very purpose of stimulating our minds to such additions as shall enhance the the universe's total value?
	[[Laozi]] cited in [[Pragmatism and Other Writings]] 112
## A2 Pragmatism

### Circular
If what you believe is that "The tru is the name of whatever proves itself to be good in the way of belief and good, too, for definite, assignable reasons," ([[Pragmatism and Other Writings]] 38) how do you know what is good? Wouldnt the goodness of some belief rely on some conception of what goodness is (that you believe is true?). How is it possible to put goodness first?

# Social Constructivism

[[Plato]]: Knowledge ought to be power: those who know the most, who are the best philosophers, ought to be rulers as a philosopher king.  ^2c6186

[[Foucault]]
Knowledge and power are inexorably linked.
"that whenever one speaks of knowledge, one is also _ipso facto_ speaking of power, and whenever one speaks of power, one is also speaking _ipso facto_ of the systems of knowledge that uphold and maintain the power relationships in question." [Zach Fruhling](https://www.zacharyfruhling.com/philosophy-blog/foucaults-concept-of-power-knowledge-explained)





# Unorganized
See [[Aristotle]]
There are 5 ways in which the mind attains truth:
- Scientific knowledge (episteme)
- Art or technical skill (techne)
- Prudence or practical wisdom (phronesis)
- Intelligence or intuition (nous)
- Wisdom (sophia)
	- Understood as both intuition and scientific knowledge
	[[Nichomachean Ethics]] 6.2-6.7

#WIP - I need to define and categorize what the names of the ideaologies that each author falls under are

## Bacon
Bacon's goal has always been to find the necessary and suffecient confitions

1. After this, he will gather data from a posteriori experience about all things sharing a common trait. 
2. Find the common trait between them that can explain the property in each thing

Find things with heat (fire, poop, animals, meat, metal in the sun, etc)
all of these things move, so therefore, all heat comes from motion.

## Mill
[[J.S. Mill]]

1. Method of difference
	Find the difference between two different variables, and measure changes in one compared to changes in the other
		This is basically the discovery of independent and dependent variables


## Whewell
[[Whewell]]
Critiqued Bacon and Mill claiming that there can be no codifiable method by which we can discover things, the thing that is crucial for discovery is the human creativity.  

Scientific discovery requires
meaningful observation requires inventing relevant categories
	Scientific observation requires concept construction
meaningful data collection is guided and constrained
	by what we take to be the relevant question
	by what we take to be relevant to our tentative answers


### A2: BACON
Bacon, designed by Langley et al, is a computer system based on a weak algorithm which claims to create scientific discoveries based on heuristics and 
	"BACON exhibits a set of processes when executed actually make scientific discoveries" ; BACON specifically found the inverse square law by connecting data, similar to how Kepler discovered it. BACON did the same with Maxwell's law and Faraday's law. 
		A2: Whewell: Scientific discovery requires *concepts* not just computation of raw data. Machines cannot use concepts so thus machines cannot make any discoveries. Inputting the specific data into BACON (that BACON would not have otherwise) is incredibly crucial to the scientific process; and its unique to humans. 

## Kant
#### Judgements of Perception and Experience
Judgements of perception; The room is warm, this sugar is sweet
Judgments of experience; Air is elastic, chairs have mass
	"That I and everybody else should nalways connect necessarily the same perceptions under the same circumstance" ([[Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics]], 47)
	This also means that Objective validity and Necessary Universality are synonyms. Necessary universality arises from the similarly constructed nature of a priori understanding. A priority -> Judgement of experience
