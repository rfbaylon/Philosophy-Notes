"A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects."
	-Robert A. Heinlein

Shall we forever resign the pleasure of construction to the carpenter? What does architecture amount to in the experience of the mass of men?... Where is this division of labour to end? and to what object does it finally serve?

"The student who secures his coveted leisure and retirement buy systematically shirking any labour necessary to man obtains by an ignoble and unprofitable leisure, defrauding himself  of the experience which alone can make leisure fruitful... How could youths better learn to live than byu at once trying the experiment of living?"
