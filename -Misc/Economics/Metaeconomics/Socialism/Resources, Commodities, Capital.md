# Resources, Commodities, Capital
"Capital is not a thing, but a social relation between persons which is mediated through things... We know that the means of productioon and subsistance, while they remain the property of the immediate producer, are not capital. They only become capital  under circumstances in which they serve at the same time as means of exploitation of, and domination over, the worker." [[Capital Volume I]], 932-933


## Forms of Commodities

#### Form A: 
20 yards of linen = 1 coat
	[[Capital Volume I]] 160-163

#### Form B
20 yards of linen = 1 coat
20 yards of linen = 1/2 chair
20 yards of linen = 10lb. tea
etc., etc.

#### Form C
20 yards of linen = X amount of any Y
(linen here becomes currency, it has obtained the universal equivalent form)

#### Form D
20 yards of linen has become socially accustomed to be synonymous with value. Form D is identical to Form C, it just appears different to the public.

### Currency!
Money (as in, say, the US Dollar) is thus not only a mere product of labor, nor a mere commodity, but a currency. MONEY IS A COMMODITY. 
Money fetishism is a form of [[Commodity Fetishism]].

## Commodity Exchange
### C - M - C
In exchange, commodities are exchanged for money which is exchanged for commodities, continuing the cycle ad infinitum
-- This process defines *all* circulation of goods and services --

#### C - M
The **first** metamorphosis of commodity
When a commodity is exchanged for money, it is exchanged for the universal shape of its own value. The buyer gets the use value.
	[[Marx]] calls this the *salto mortale* on the part of the seller.

#### M - C
The **second** metamorphosis of the commodity
Now that the seller has money from selling the initial commodity, they become a buyer.

Nothing could be more foolish than the dogma tat because every sale is a purchase, and every purchase a sale, the circulation of commodities necessarily implies an equilibrium between sales and purchases" [[Capital Volume I]] 208

## To Capital!

While the form of commodity exchange is the formula C-M-C, the primary form of capital is M-C-M.

#### M-C-M
While C- M - C's main goal is to use currency as a means to get use value from a commodity, M -C - M is used to gain exchange value from a commodity. 

#### M-C-M'
##### And the creation of *surplus value*
The milking of exchange value from the form M-C-M turns into the formula M-C-M'. The increase from M to M' is called *surplus value.* This creation of surplus value is the backbone of Capital, and is what allows capitalism to flourish.
	M' = M + Î”M

There are two types of Capital
	Constant Capital capital which is advanced to replace the cost of the means of production
	Variable Capital: Capital that is advanced to replace (and exploit) labor. Variable capital is where surplus value comes from. 

##### So where exactly does surplus value come from?
Surplus Value (S-V) comes from workers laboring for more hours than is socially necessary. S-V is objectified surplus labor time. 

Here's a diagram :)
~~~
1. A-------B--C
2. A-------B----C
3. A-------B-------C

Vector A-C represents the working day of a laborer.
Vector A-B represents the length of socially necessary labor power.
Vector B-C represents the surplus labor time extracted by the capitalist.
~~~

The larger the B-C is, the greater the exploitation is. 
ALL of the production that occurs between B-C is not for the sake of the worker, all of the value instead goes to capitalists. The first vector has less exploitation than the third.
	If AB = BC (like in working day 3), then the rate of exploitation is 100%.

Two types of surplus value:
	Absolute S-V: Surplus value created by lengthening the working day
		Scamming Workers
	Relative S-V: Surplus value created by decreasing the quality of the product
		Scalping, Manipulation, Advertisement, Scamming Customers
Either way, whether S-V is relative or absolute, a profit is made by decreasing the L-T of the final profit.

## Reproduction of Exchange Value
**"Commodities must be sold, their value must be realized in their money, this money must be transformed once again into capital, and so on, again and again. This cycle, in which the same phases are continually gone though in succession, forms the circulation of capital"     ([[Capital Volume I]], 709)

### The Need for Reproduction
Me with your mom
"Every social process of production is at the same time a process of reproduction" [[Capital Volume I]], 711

In order for an economy to function, part of the value of the production must be reconverted into new means of production or new resources. After all of the machines (or other MoP) are used up, how can anyone make anything new?

$ of capital / (S-V/T) = # of time-units it takes to replace original capital

"The capitalist process of production, therefore, seen as a total, connected process, i.e, a process of reproduction, produces not only commodities, not only surplus value, but it also produces and reproduces the capital relation itself; on the wone hand the capitalist, on the other the wage laborer" ([[Capital Volume I]], 724)

#### Accumulation of Capital
"Accumulation is the conquest of the world of social wealth." ([[Capital Volume I]], 739)

Before, the analysis focused on how surplus value came from capital. Now, we analyze how capital comes from surplus value.
	"The employment of surplus value as capital, or its reconversion into captial is called accumulation of capital." ([[Capital Volume I]], 725)
	
Thus, the more surplus value one has, the more capital they can attain. With more capital, one can make even more surplus value. Ad infinitum. 
	its also important to note that capital is objectified surplus labor. Every instance of capital is the guise of countless hours of exploited labor.

"Accumulate, accumulate!... Therefore save save, i.e., reconvert the greatest possible portion of surplus product into capital! Accumulation for the sake of accumulation, production for the sake of production: this was the formula in which classical economists expressed the historical mission of the bourgeoisie in the period of its domination... If, in the eyes of classical economics, the proletarian is merely a machine for the production of surplus value, the capitalist too is merely a machine for the transformation of this surplus value into surplus capital" [[Capital Volume I]], 742

Some results of accumulation are:
	Higher wage gaps between the capitalists and proletariat
		Historically, wages dont follow accumulation
	Centralization of money
	More individual social power for capital owners
	And...

#### Monopolization
See [[Economies of Scale]]

Accumulation of surplus value in the hands of few allows for rapid expansion of capital by these individuals at the detriment of others.

Centralization of capital is incredibly rapid (as investors can pump and dump certain stocks as necessary once they have capital), but accumulation is a slow process for one individual as they have less resources. Competition and credit are the two factors that lead to centralization. 

Centralized entities became monopolies that could control large swaths of market via their previous (and continuous stream of) capital.

## Colonialism 
"Imperialism is the final stage of capitalism." - [[Lenin]]

Because labor can be found much cheaper overseas than domestically, there is incredible incentive to hire and raid othering nations in order to secure the most labor for the least amount of money. This can be explored much more in depth in [[Colonialism]] and [[Neocolonialism]]
