# Contradictions
See [[Marx]], [[Zizek]]

### Use Value and Exchange Value
The price of an object does not in fact reflect its value; these things are entirely independent. Price ceases to express value despite the fact that money is nothing but the value-form of commodities. Thus things that are not commodities can have a price (honor, ethics, etc). If this is true, what even is price? "Hence a thing can, formally speaking,  have a price without having value" [[Capital Volume I]], 197

### Inequality in Commodity Exchange
If there are people buying and selling commodities, there will end up a point by which some people will end up with nonliquid commodities and will not be able to sell them. This is a contradiction though because, as mentioned in [[Resources, Commodities, Capital]], C - M and M - C are literally identical. Thus in a period in which everyone wants to hold money, they negate the equivalence of money and the commodity being bought and sold. Exchanging a commodity for money will always be better (economically) as it is liquid: there are more options for it to go. A commodity (supposedly) of the same value will be less desirable. This stand still is what creates boom and bust cycles.
[[Capital Volume I]], 209

### Hoarding of Money
It is in everyone's best interests to accrue as much money (gold, silver, paper bills) as possible as liquid assets are more 'valuable' than nonliquid assets. These liquid assets do not have any use value though. Thus, everyone is incentivized to hoard as much money as possible and to not exchange it for things with a use value.
[[Capital Volume I]], 228
	"This contradiction between the quantitative limitation and the qualitative lack of limitation of money keeps driving the hoarder back to his Sisyphean task: accumulation... Work, thrift, and greed are therefore his three cardinal virtues, and to sell much and buy little is the sum of his political economy" [[Capital Volume I]], 231

### Nonproductive Creation of Value
This is ONLY a contradiction from the capitalist perspective: it can make perfect sense how this occurs with the LTV lens.
	It is a contradiction that v (a quantity of value) can come into fruition, but by repition creates v'. It makes no sense how the same amount of value can double with no external labor. It is creating something from nothing, which just isnt possible.
		[[Capital Volume I]], 323-325

### Infinite Growth on a Finite Planet
A central law of capitalism is "that the minimum amount of capital which the capitalist must process has to go on increasing." ([[Capital Volume I]], 480) This is impossible with finite resources, meaning capitalism will fail eventually.
