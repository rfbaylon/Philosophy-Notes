>> While the slave is bound to their labor by a chain, the wage laborer is bound to their labor by an invisible string: Capital

## What is Alienation?

## Different Forms

#### Alienation from Products of Labor

#### Alienation from Process of Labor

#### Alienation from Community

#### Alienation from Self

#### Alienation from Nonhuman World

## Different Causes

### Radical Division of Labor
#### Causing Alienation from Self
See [[Marx]], [[Smith]]

As someone workers more specialized jobs, their jobs become more routine, more boring, and more dull. Working 10 hours per day performing tasks that take 3 seconds each will crush the soul of any individual, alienating him from himself.
At the same time, this produces more for the capitalist. ([[Economies of Scale]])
[[Marx]] also argues that [[Automation]] exacerbates this alienation by constantly threatening the worker's job.
	"The understandings of the grater part of men are necessarily formed by their ordinary employments. The man whose whole life is spent in performing a few simple operations... has no occasion to exert his understanding,,, He generally becomes stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to become." [[Capital Volume I]], 483
	"Not only is the specialized work  distributed among different individuals, but the individual himself is divided up, and transformed into the automatic motor of a detailed operation... making man a mere fragment of his body" ([[Capital Volume I]], 481-482)
	"In manufacture, the social productive power of the collective worker, hence of capital, is enriched through the impoverishment of the worker in individual productive power" ([[Capital Volume I]], 483)
	"To subdivide man is to execute him... The subdivision of labor is the assassination of a people" ([[Capital Volume I]], 484-485)
	"A shortage of hands is complained of, while, at the same time, many thousands are out of work, because the division of labor chains them to a particular branch of industry." ([[Capital Volume I]], 795)

#### Causing Alienation from Products of Labor
See [[Marx]], [[Specialization]]
If someone spends their entire life making one tiny part of a product, they have no attachment to the product in the end as they only see themselves as a very small part of the final product. The product is far from *their* work. 

### [[Automation]]
See [[Marx]]

#### Causing Alienation from Community
Automation leads directly to increased monopolization of resources, and decreased cooperation
	"A single machine, when it takes the place of cooperation or of manufacture, may itself serve as the basis of an industry of a handicraft character." [[Capital Volume I]], 589

### Servitude to Accumulation
#### Causing Alienation from Self
See [[Marx]]
Accumulation of capital, in classical economics makes it such that the proletariat work in order to make surplus value, making their life less innately valuable. On the other side of the coin though, capitalists are also a slave to capital in that their own fruits and leisure come at the cost of the maxim of accumulation
	"Accumulate, accumulate!... Therefore save save, i.e., reconvert the greatest possible portion of surplus product into capital! Accumulation for the sake of accumulation, production for the sake of production: this was the formula in which classical economists expressed the historical mission of the bourgeoisie in the period of its domination... If, in the eyes of classical economics, the proletarian is merely a machine for the production of surplus value, the capitalist too is merely a machine for the transformation of this surplus value into surplus capital" [[Capital Volume I]], 742

### Economic Incentive For Tragedy of the Commons
#### Causing Alienation from Nonhuman World
See [[Vogel]]
Everyone is equally incentivized to pollute, drive cars, etc. Even if the individual actors care about the environment (even if *everybody* cared about the environment), this destruction of the nonhuman world will still occur as it would be economic suicide not to. 
	"An aggregation of acts each of which paradoxically  takes the aggregation itself as given and unalterable. This is what Marx means by saying that our own deed comes to be an alien power against us." [[Thinking like a Mall]], 203
