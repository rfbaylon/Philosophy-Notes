### A2 Socialism: Laziness
If people are paid the same thing no matter what, they will become lazy and produce less.
	A2A2: [[Marx]]: "If under normal, i.e. average social conditions of production, x pounds of cotton are made into y pounds of yarn by one hour's labor, then a day's labor does not count as 12 hour's ;labor unless 12x pounds of cotton have been made into 12y pounds of yarn; for only socially necessary labor time counts towards the creation of value." [[Capital Volume I]], 296

### A2 Socialism: The Mudpie Objection
If it were some ones job to make mudpies in the dirt, they would be exerting the same amount of labor power and time as someone producing something with social utility
			A2A2: "Human labor-power creates value, but is not itself value. It becomes value in its coagulated state, in objective form" [[Capital Volume I]], 142
			Socially necessary labor power creates value; labor power itself does not. If making mudpies were socially valuable, then it would create value.
				"If the capitalist has a foible for using golden spindles instead of steel ones, the only labor that counts for anything in the value of the produced yarn remains that which would be required to produce a steel spindle, because no more is necessary under the given conditions" [[Capital Volume I]], 295
