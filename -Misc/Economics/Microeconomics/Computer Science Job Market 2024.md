## AI Dev Jobs
The 2024 Work Trend Index Annual Report by Microsoft and LinkedIn indicates that AI skills may become as important as job experience in the hiring process. The research shows that the majority of business leaders (66%) will not consider hiring a candidate who does not possess AI skills. In fact, 71% of executives say they prefer to hire a candidate with AI skills, even if they have less experience, over a more experienced candidate who lacks an aptitude for AI.

After spending some time looking into what jobs actually look like, I think today its often just used as a software developer title. All I could find require hard coding skills and background in CS. Often, they are designing the UI/UX of the chatbot, how the chatbot responds, and reading in user inputs. All of the people hiring are software companies, not like finance companies looking for someone to help them use ChatGPT.
