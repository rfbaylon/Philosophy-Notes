- Note that all of these arguments are not arguments against automation, only how automation is currently used in the capitalist system.

### Social Uselessness
See [[Marx]], [[Graeber]], [[J.S. Mill]]
There is no data to support a correlation between working hours decreasing and automation increasing. Because of this, there seems to be no social utility to increased automation.
	[[J.S. Mill]]: " It is questionable if all the mechanical inventions yet made have lightened the day's toil of any human being" #Cite 
In fact, we spend tax dollars and social capital in developing automation that costs nothing to capital, but is used to oppress the people who fund it.
	A2: [[Destiny]] You're forgetting about the reduced cost of goods and services. Automation profits don't just go into the pockets of capital owners, they are put towards reducing costs due to competition between firms.

### Extended Working Days
See [[Marx]]
Because machines are a large upfront cost to capitalists, and their use is required to make money, capitalists are directly incentivised to hire workers for longer periods of time in order to squeeze all of the machines utility out of it as possible.
	"When a laborer lays down his spade, he renders useless, for that period, a capital worth eighteen pence. When one of our people leaves the mill, he renders useless a capital that cost $100,000." [[Capital Volume I]], 529
