SN: Socially Necessary
L-P: Labor Power
	SNL-P: Socially Necessary Labor Power
L-T: Labor Time
	SNL-T Socially Necessary Labor Time
MoP: Means of Production
S-V: Surplus Value


[[Marx]]'s formula for Value
	SNL-P/ μ Hours + Value of MoP + Value of Resources = Commodity Value

Marx's formula for Capital
	MoP + Value(L-P) = Capital

Marx's formula for Surplus Value
	μ L-P x (S-L / SN-L) x # of workers
	μ S-V / day x (Σ variable capital) = S-V

[[Marx]]'s formula for exploitation
	SNL-T / Surplus L-T
	S-V / L-P = Rate of S-V

[[Marx]]'s formula for the rate of S-V
	--- I ---
	S-V / Variable Capital = S-V / Value of L-P
	S-V / Variable Capital = S-L / SNL-P
	--- II ---
	S-L / Working Day = S-V / Value of Product
	S-L / Working Day = Surplus Product / Total Product
	--- III ---
	S-V / Value of L-P = S-L / SNL-P = Unpaid Labor / Paid Labor

[[Marx]]'s Formula for Time Wage
	T-W = L-P /  Time
		(Juxtapose time wage to piece wage, or the exchange value of labor)
