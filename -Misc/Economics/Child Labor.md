“In regard to case 1, when asked the question “To what extent should child labor be allowed in the United States”, the Northeastern Ethics Debate Forum argues that insofar as children need to work in order to thrive, child labor ought to be defended.

To answer the titular question, the children do yearn for the mines, but only because American and Global Capitalist socioeconomic forces leave them nothing else to yearn for.

### Preface
For the purposes of this discussion, we will take child work and child labor to be the same thing. We will define both as the extraction of economic value from children. These can include anything from household chores to child trafficking -- some are obviously permissible, others obviously beyond reprehensible.

The vast majority opinion is on the near absolute ban of child labor. In order to motivate our position, we need to acknowledge the privilege of those who hold that view, those who were lucky enough to not need to work as a child. 

Finally, and most importantly, we want to focus not on when it is wrong to use children for economic extraction, but rather on when a state should allow it

Failures of Squo
Prudential reasons for encouraging school
- Well educated students are much better for the economy.
	- Every dollar spent on bettering education returns 20 for GDP
Moral reasons for encouraging school
- Well educated students are much better citizens
- Upholding democracy
- Better interpersonal interactions
- Less poverty, higher wellbeing in the future
- The extent of these benefits create a strong obligation for governments to provide good schools and good support for schools. 
- Making school a better option for children than working at burger king is the bare minimum.
- Kids who work long term, when asked, very often prefer to go to school than work. Islam and Hoque 2022 find that the main reason children work is because they are pushed to do so because of poverty.

Given this: The fact that child labor is still incentivised at all makes no sense. It's better for nearly all stakeholders that children are incentivised (not just legally!) to go to school

### The Necessity of Child Labor
Unfortunately, child labor is needed in the United States because our economic institutions aren't set up to support poor children.
#### The Stats
According to DOL, the number of minors employed in violation of child labor laws in fiscal year 2022 increased 37% over FY2021 and 283% over FY2015. The number of minors employed in violation of hazardous occupation orders increased 26% over FY2021 and 94% over FY2015 (DOL WHD 2022)

#### The Harsh Reality
Many families cannot make ends meet in the United States, especially if they are intersectionally screwed over. In order to put food on the table, cover medical costs, or have a home many families need their children to supplement wages. Children like these are substantially worse off being barred from work than allowed.
#### Black Market Labor Bad
Without regulations or oversight, children have no course of action for injustices they face in the workplace. Much like illegal immigrants, their employment and livelihood is held over their heads to justify mistreatment.
Happens commonly especially in agriculture where many workers are both illegal and children.

### Sensitivities

#### Justice
Fair Pay: Children are less able to fight for employee protections, fair wages, and other goods due to disenfranchisement. Surprisingly, in a global analysis, children are just as productive as adults (?!), but receive substantially less money than adults do. 
#### Physical/mental harm
There may be work which children, by nature of their developing bodies, are just unable to do.


## Child Work Vs Child Labor
There is said to be a distinction between so-called child work and child labor. Child work is the work that an individual does for ones family directly and safely (working a family farm, chores, assisting with a small business, babysitting). Child labor is said to be child work that is harmful. Under this definition Child labor is to child work like killing is to murder.
I don't think this distinction is useful, as it erases a lot of important nuance around the discussion. If child labor is just morally wrong child work, then we will happily say all child labor is wrong (by definition!). We think that the distinction just lazily punts the question. 
Abolitionist position: Children should be in school, free from financial responsibilities, and protected from the harms that the working life may have on their development and opportunities. Labor is harmful, restricts opportunities, and exploits children, thus, child labor should be abolished.

### The Worst kinds of Child Labor
These include slavery, sex trafficking, indentured servitude, and other egregious forms of child labor. These ought to be uncontroversially abolished as swiftly and efficiently as possible. 
For the rest of our speech, we will put these cases to the side as they are fortunately the vast minority of cases and hopefully an uncontroversial area of agreement. 

### 3 Potential Harms of Child Labor
Following the work of Phillip Cook, there are 3 potential ways in which child labor can harm children. We will describe the legal and moral cases and limits for each of them.

#### Positive Harms
The first is that children are more vulnerable to harm in the workplace.

There are obviously jobs that exist that children ought not do because they are simply unable to do them -- whether that is because of lacking physical or psychological development. Any attempts at jobs like these would be incredibly harmful for children -- so harmful in fact, that they ought to be banned.

**Caveats**
- Claiming the vulnerability of a subject to a certain activity does not necessarily imply or justify the incapacitation and restriction of the subject to exercise the activity. (women are vulnerable when walking at night, that doesn't mean we restrict women).
- In many cases in the United States as well, the harms of poverty in a family may be substantially worse than the harms of increased workplace vulnerability. Hunger, instability, disease, and other harms of poverty could (and often do) outweigh the harms of labor. That's why they do it in the first place!
- A harm for the child based account might be difficult to prove due to nonidentity problems. 
**Solution**
- Children should not be allowed to work in the most dangerous work environments, including most construction, oil rigging, electricity, metal working, logging, etc. Mentally exhausting work should also be excluded such as meat packing and slaughter. 

#### Negative Harms
The second is that children are deprived of the more-valuable schooling when at work. This is a harm due to failing to give rather than causing harm. 

**Harms**
- We argue that when talking just about the US, Kindergarten-High school, in the vast majority of cases, will make children better off than otherwise. 
- We agree with current laws that if individuals want to drop out of highschool by sophomore year to pursue work, they are welcome to.
- Beyond this, it is so good for kids that it would be wrong to not force kids to go to school roughly up to sophomore year. Benefits include: 
	- Being able to read/write, 
	- Basic math, useful for finances and opening up jobs in future, 
	- History/English/Science education, necessary for democracy, 
	- English education, sparks aesthetic appreciation, allows for more job options
	- Place with teachers who have no incentive to use children who can guide/advise them (as opposed to jobs and potentially families)
- We acknowledge that these benefits could theoretically be learned better in the workplace, but on net in the status quo, being forced to go to school will be better for student who would otherwise be put to work with worse educational outcomes than those who will be put to work for better education outcomes.
  
**Caveats**
These are two ways in which benefits of child labor may surpass these harms:

- This argument is entirely contingent on the quality of schools in one’s area.
	- We acknowledge all of the failings of US schooling, and would welcome pairing our case with substantial educational overhaul in order to give kids the best possible schooling. Strengthening the quality of schools weakens the case for child labor. 
- Also, insofar as children are schooled, there is no harm here regarding child labor. 
- We also acknowledge that especially poor and/or undocumented laboring families require their children to work in order to support themselves.

**Solution**
- School ought to be required for children, so long as it is more beneficial for them economically, physically, and mentally than laboring. 
	- In implementing policy, we will need to obviously consider which statistical tails will be cut.
- Child labor is first and foremost a class issue. The children, unquestionably, do not yearn for the mines. When a wealthy state fails to make schooling more beneficial for a child than working at Burger King, the state has irrevocably failed.  We (quite literally) take it to be tantamount to neglect to not provide kids with high quality schooling opportunities and financial support for poor and undocumented resident families. 
	- According to DOL, the number of minors employed in violation of child labor laws in fiscal year 2022 increased 37% over FY2021 and 283% over FY2015. The number of minors employed in violation of hazardous occupation orders increased 26% over FY2021 and 94% over FY2015 (DOL WHD 2022)
#### Justice Based Harms
The third is that often children are exploited (even when they are not harmed or made better off by working). This is a consideration of justice.  

**Harms**
Children are less able to fight for employee protections, fair wages, and other goods due to disenfranchisement.
Surprisingly, in a global analysis, children are just as productive as adults (?!), but receive less money than adults do. This is a harm even if the kids are better off working.
Cook doesn't mention this in his paper, but exploitation is not just from employers. It can also be from parents.
Case examples are Shia Lebouff, as explored through his film Honey Boy, where his father used him as the sole support for them despite being able to get a job himself. Another similar example is Jannette McCurdy of iCarly as explained in her recent memoir.

**Caveats**
Banning work for children simply to avoid exploitation puts the burden on the victim, not on the perpetrator. 

**Solutions**
School provides a place for children who have very few trustworthy adults in their life to either get advice or report abuse. Teachers may be the only people in childrens’ life that are not monetarily incentivized to exploit them
Child laborers also ought to be encouraged to unionize (as they have in Bolivia)
Childrens Labor commissioners ought to be appointed (as many already have) in order to fight for the rights of children in the workplace, to make sure they are not disenfranchised. 
Currently, the national minimum wage for children is only $4.25. Children ought to be given the same minimum wage as adults for the same jobs.
Equality for agricultural workers is tantamount. Most child labor in the United States occurs in the agricultural sector, the area with the least regulations for all workers. This also intersects with race as well, as Mexican immigrants make up disproportionate amounts of farmworkers.’

Counter Arguments
Counters to your case and how you would respond to them. You should have at least 3 solid counters

We expect many counterarguments to come, but really want to emphasize in this space that this is an incredibly nuanced situation. There are incredibly socioeconomic pressures in place for many to forces children to work. Here, we need to be discussing first and foremost what is best for the kids themselves through understanding the situations in which kids come to labor. 

Abolitionism
There is no situation in which child labor is OK.
Importantly, as noted at the outset, child labor includes babysitting and mowing lawns. Things that are not only not obviously harmful to children, but potentially beneficial.
This ignores so many deep economic realities of children. Disallowing them from work means that they are less able to mitigate their hunger, disease, insecurity, and homelessness. It strips the already vulnerable of even more agency. 

Why not attack the root issues?
Child labor is caused by child poverty, caused by the social conditions of the proletariat. Why even compromise regarding child labor when we could pass vast economic reform?
Though we agree that a world in which children don't need to work is ideal, we need to work through policy in order to provide tractable, immediate relief and agency. In other words, getting rid of the root issues is the goal, child labor reforms are the way to get there.
