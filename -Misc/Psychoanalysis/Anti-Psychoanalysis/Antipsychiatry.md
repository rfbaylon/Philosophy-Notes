"Psychoanalysis continues to ask questions and develop interpretations from the depths of the Oedipal Triangle as its basic perspective... The psychoanalyst says we must *necessarily* discover Schreber's daddy beneath his superior God" [[Anti-Oedipus]], 14

"I don't believe in father in mother, got no papamummy"

### Hallucinations and Delusions
"A celibate misery and glory experienced to the fullest, like a cry suspended between life and death, an intense feeling of transition, states of pure, naked intensity stripped of all shape and form. These are often described as hallucinations and delirium, but the basic phenomenon of hallucination (I see, I hear) and the basic phenomenon of delirium (I think . . . ) presuppose an I feel at an even deeper level, which gives hallucinations their object and thought delirium its contentâ€”an "I feel that I am becoming a woman," "that I am becoming a god," and so on, which is neither delirious nor hallucinatory, but will project the hallucination or internalize the delirium." [[Anti-Oedipus]], 19

"How does psychoanalysis go about reducing a person to a pitiful creature who eternally consumes daddy-and-mommy and nothing else? How could the conjunctive synthesis of "So that's what it was!" and "So it's me!" have been reduced to the endless, dreary discovery of Oedipus: "So it's my father, my mother"?" [[Anti-Oedipus]], 20

"(Neurotics must be defined in terms of modern territorialities" [[Anti-Oedipus]], 35
