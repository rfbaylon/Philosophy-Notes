What is Ideology?

As opposed to the the classic [[Utilitarianism]] doctrine "the ends justify the means," Ideology reverses it in the mind of the subject: the means justify the ends.

## Biopower
See [[Foucault]], [[Deleuze]] & [[Guattari]], [[Reich]]

"*There is only desire and the social, and nothing else...* Reich refuses to accept ignorance or illusion as the origin of fascism. According to [[Reich]], the rise of fascism was not born of a large amount of innocent dupes, but rather from a large scale process of fascist-desire production" [[Anti-Oedipus]], 29
	This quote links incredibly powerfully when taken in conjunction with [[Foucault]]'s conception of [[Biopower]].
