# Jainist Metaphysics

### Jiv / Ajiv
Ajiv - Anything that does not have the life or a consciousness is Ajiva. Ajiva literally means without a soul and therefore, they cannot accumulate any karmas. They have no birth, death, pleasure, or pain; they are achetan (inert). Examples of Ajivas are: a box, car, fan, television, photo frame, iron, watch, etc. [Source]([https://jainworld.com/philosophy/fundamentals/non-living-things-ajiv/](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://jainworld.com/philosophy/fundamentals/non-living-things-ajiv/&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1658947077606661&usg=AOvVaw1t9bugYrX7OZV6XBT-1TP9))

Jiv - The jiva which grows, decays, fluctuates, varies, eats, sleeps, awakes, acts, fears, rests, has knowledge and perception, attempts to self defend, and reproduces. [Source]([https://jainworld.com/philosophy/fundamentals/living-being-jiv-soul/](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://jainworld.com/philosophy/fundamentals/living-being-jiv-soul/&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1658947077611728&usg=AOvVaw0hEl4LjInrxbatnAiJFB5_))

The jiv is like a wet lollipop dragged through sand. 
	When a bad action occurs (an action that will give the subject karma), it will make the lollipop wetter, and thus more attractive to sand (representing Karma). When the lollipop is dry, it will let the sand move near it, but never attach and be the best lollipop ever. 

A soul with a lot of karma will reincarnate as a lesser being (such as a dog or a woman) and a soul with minimal karma will reincarnate in nirvana or as a god.

# Jainist Ethics

## 3 Gems of Jainism (Ratnatraye) are 
1. Right Belief
2. Right Knowledge
3. Right Conduct
	Right conduct is defined by the following principles:

[Ahiṃsā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahimsa_in_Jainism) (Non-violence)
	Allows self defense
	Needs to be vegetarian
[Satya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya#Jainism) (Truth)
[Asteya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteya#Jainism) (Non-stealing)
[Brahmacharya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmacharya#Brahmacharya_in_Jainism) (Chastity)
	Give up sex after having a son
	No sex outside of marriage
[Aparigraha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aparigraha) (Non-possession)
	Jains must only possess what they need.
	Jains must use surplus possessions to benefit others.
	Jains must live simply.
	Jains must not use too many resources.

By following this, the goal for Jains is the escape samsara and to reach nirvana. With an akarmic soul, they can ascend.


# Jainist Issues

Jains have to buy flat earth is real
This means that everything that happens to an individual is entirely deserved
	This leads to a harsh caste system
