## Mahayana & Theravada Buddhisms

### Mahayana Buddhism
See [[Zen Buddhism]], [[Chan Buddhism]]
"The Great Vehicle of Buddhism"
Mahayana and Theravada Buddhism are two different categories of Buddhism. Mahayana Buddhism is focused on the enlightenment of all. Mahayana Buddhists focus on engaging their community at large about the teachings of the Buddhas so that all can be enlightened. 
This is what leads to the belief in 'Buddhist Saints,' or Bodhisattvas -- students of the Buddha who could transcend this world but choose to stay here to help people attain enlightenment. 

### Theravada Buddhism
See [[Vajrayana Buddhism]]
Derogatorily called "The Lesser Vehicle of Buddhism" or "Hinayana Buddhism"
Mahayana and Theravada Buddhism are two different categories of Buddhism. Theravada Buddhism is focused only on the enlightenment of individual people practicing. 


Truth has no path, and that is the beauty of truth, it is living. A dead thing has a path to it because it is static, but when you see that truth is something living, moving, which has no resting place, which is in no temple, mosque or church, which no religion, no teacher, no philosopher, nobody can lead you to-then you will also see that this living thing is what you actually are-your anger, your brutality, your violence, your despair, the agony and sorrow you live in.
