[[Foucault]] develops his theory of juridical power and negative power by which language acts can either build up oppressors or harm minorities. This analysis is limited though. 
	Slurs have both negative and positive derogatory power:  the harming of the victim aand the lifting of the user.

#### What is a slur?
Here, when I say slur, I mean 'deeply derogatoy language'
See Tirrell 2012, 190-193
1. They express and insider/outsider function (without an assumption of escapability)
	e.g., "snob" might fit this, but doesnt since one can cease being a 'snob.' The term here is a critique rather than an assigning of ontological status
2. They must commuinicate a negative message presumed to convey an essential and negative aspect of the target, and in doing so, either create or reinforce a hierarchy.
3.  They will be more powerful if they are embedded in already existing networks of oppression.
4. Sometimes, with 1, they set limits on behavior for a 3rd party.
	"For example, Fred and Ethel see Lucy do something silly, and while Ethel laughs, Fred scornfully says, Lucy is “ such a bimbo.” ‘Bimbo’ is a gendered term, and its use here sets boundaries ‘ on acceptable and unacceptable female behavior. Whatever Lucy was doing, Ethel now knows not to do that in front of Fred. His use of the derogatory term sets gender boundaries for Ethel even though he was hurling the term at Lucy." Tirrell, 2012, 192
5. They engender actions from the dominant group
	e.g., calling a woman a 'girl' allows paternalistic and oppressive behavior of a man
## Speech to Violence Pipeline
See Tirrell, 2012

Speech in the use of slurs generates permission for violent actions.

### Case Study: The Rwandan Genocide

"Language did not do the whole job, but the infusion of linguistic violence into the social body engendered a breadth and depth of physical violence that went beyond war and into genocide."
	Tirrell, 2012, 200 #Quote 

the most common slurs for Tutsis were inyenzi and inzoka, "cockroach" and "snake" respectively. In Rwanda, boys are proud when they are chosen to cut off the heads of snakes. 

Inferences of Inyenzi:
See [[Pests (Rats)]]
	"Common inferences include that cockroaches are *pests*, dirty, ubiquitous, multiply rapidly, are hard to kill, ought to be killed, show emergent tendencies when in groups, are resilient, carry diseases, can go long periods without food or water, tend to only emerge at night when they are hard to see."

In Rwanda, before the genocide, it was common for Hutus to use derogatory names for Tutsis in good jest, as jokes. They would make fun of Tutsis and share a beer after. These foundations grew the groundwork for their subjugation though.

RTLM Radio in Rwanda:
	"*I have always told you. All the people who joined the part controlled by the Inyenzi Inkotanyi are Inyenzi themselves. They approve the killings perpetrated by Inyenzi. They are criminals like the Inyenzi Inkotanyi. They are all Inyenzi. When our armed forces will get there, they will get what they deserve. They will not spare anyone since everybody turned Inyenzi. All those who stayed there are all Inyenzi since those who were against Inyenzi have been killed by Inyenzi. Those who succeeded to escape ran away to Ngara, Burundi and to the western part of our country. Those who stayed are accomplices and acolytes of the Inyenzi.*"
	Note the repeated use of 'they,' 'our,' and 'Inyenzi'
