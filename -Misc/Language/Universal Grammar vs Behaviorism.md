### [[Deleuze]] & [[Guattari]]
"The only possible definition of language is the set of all current order-words, implicit presuppositions, or speech" [[A Thousand Plateaus]], 79
"Language is the transmission of order words, insofar as each statement accomplishes an act and the act is accomplished in the statement" [[A Thousand Plateaus]], 79
	These lingustic assemblages combine in a regime of signs or a semiotic machine
