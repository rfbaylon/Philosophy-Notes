"Language casts sheaves of reality upon the social body" - Monique [[Wittig]]
	[[Gender Trouble]], 141

# Formation of Reality
"Language, for [[Wittig]], is a set of acts, repeated over time, that produce reality-effects that are eventually misperceived as facts" [[Gender Trouble]], 147

We constantly pass from order-words to the silent order of things, and vice versa.

"Words are not tools, but we give children language, pens, and notebooks as we give workers shovels and pickaxes... Language is not life; it gives orders" [[A Thousand Plateaus]], 76

## What is a Major Language
A Major language is one by which maintains an arborescent model of linguistics; there maintains one master signifier which remains the locus and origin of language. For [[Chomsky]], this would be Universal Grammar (See [[Universal Grammar vs Behaviorism]]). 


## What is a Minor Language
See [[Kafka]]
An individual will never speak in different "branches" of a different, but in a plurality of 'minor languages' that are relational to other minor languages. There is no master signifier of language, as [[Chomsky]] seems to think, but rather an assemblage of different languages used in different ways.
	"In the course of a single day, an individual speaks as father-to-sn and as a boss-to-workers; to his lover he speaks an infantilized langauge; while sleeping he is plunbged into an oniric discourse, then abruptly  returns to a professional language when the telephone rings" [[A Thousand Plateaus]], 94.
The division of major languages into dialects still inherits many issues as it still holds languages to the master signifier of the "pure" major language. There should not be any conversation of a language as the child of a major language, but discussion of the minor language in itself. 
	The Quebecois language must be evaluated not only in relation to standard French but also in relation to major English, from which it borrows all kinds of phonetic and syntactical elements, in order to set them in variation. The Bantu dialects must be evaluated  not only in relation to the mother tongue but also in relation to also in relation to Afrikaans as a major language, and English as a counter-major language preferred by Blacks. In short, the notion of dialect foes not elucidate that of a minor language, but the other way around; it is the minor language that defines dialects through tis own possibilities fo variation.
