## A2 Adaptive Preferences

### Bad History
The female body was seen in the [[Aristotle]]an tradition as the deformed male body -- if you wanted to be female, you were preferring suboptimal
Gayness, for a while, was seen as pathological. Preferring to be gay rather than straight is under this view, suboptimal

### Overgeneralization
See [[Barnes]]
Cis men report that their sex does not negatively impact their wellbeing, but being male severely and permanently constricts mens options. They cannot become pregnatn, lactate, or give birth. Faced with these limited options, cis men adapt and remain content with their lives.That en do this may be an admirable coping mechanism, but their preferencaes dont by themselvs give evidence that being male is just as good as being female. We *all* adapt our preferences due to the limits of our bodies, but its absurd to say that all of these are adaptive.
