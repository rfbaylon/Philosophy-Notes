### Argument from the Turing Test
#WIP 
	A2: A dog cannot pass the imitation game, but still thinks
	A2: A peasant in the middle ages will be much easier to fool than a human today; claiming that the machines thinking ability depends on the guesses of others seems counter intuitive. It should be thinking either way, and in one case we dont have the tools to measure it
	A2: Why human intelligence? Is this test not incredibly anthropocentric?

#### Case Study: Parry
"“Parry” which its inventors claim has already passed a rudimentary version of the
Turing test. In a series of remotely conducted interviews, Parry fooled several psychiatrists who were told they were talking to either a computer or a paranoid patient. This was an improvement over an earlier version, in which psychiatrists were imply handed transcripts of short interviews and asked to determine which ones were with a genuine paranoid and which ones with a computer simulation." (Pg 16, Dennett, 2007)

### Argument from Phenomenological Simulation
See [[Dennett]]
If you genuinely felt wet, felt the rushings winds of, heard the sensations related to, and saw flying cars due to a hurricane, how exactly would you differentiate it from a simulation of a hurricane? Hurricanes, along with all other aposteriori phenomena are defined by their doing. [[Process]]
	"Suppose you consider a really deep simulation of a hurricane -- I mean a simulation of every atom, which I admit is impossibly deep. I hope you would agree that it would then share all that abstract structure that defines the “essence of hurricanehood.” So what’s to hold you back from calling it a hurricane?" (Pg 7, Dennett, 2007)

### Argument from a priori Simulation
See [[Dennett]]
If a calculator comes up with a mathematical proof, it is exactly the same as a collegue coming up with a proof. What even is a simulation of a proof? Ergo, machines do not produce simulations of things, but real things via cognitive processes.

### Argument from Identity
See [[Karnofsky]]
If we were to replace one neuron in a brain with a techno-neuron, it seems like you would feel no difference, cognition would still happen. At no point from the transformation of one to all neurons, does that change. You will still be thinking. [[Most Important Century]], 40

### Argument from the Physical Symbol System Hypothesis
See Newell and Simon
See [[Mind Models]]
Because humans are PSSs,
Because humans think by virtue of them being a PSS,
Therefore, Machines think

# No

### God Didn't Give Machines Souls
The Bible says god solely endowed men with cognition
	A2: [[Turing]]: If it were impossible for machines to think, God would be limited in His power, a theological contradiction (Turing, 1950)

### Head in the sand
I really don't like thinking about machines thinking :(
	A2: Cope harder (Turing, 1950)

### [[Godel]]'s theorem Limits Answers
See [[Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem]]
With certain sets of axioms, a machine's response will either be incomplete or wrong
	A2: [[Turing]] This is also true of humans (Turing, 1950)

### Argument from Consciousness
Thinking presupposes qualia. Machines do not have qualia. Ergo, machines do not think.
	A2: [[Turing]] This also applies to humans, but since it is impossible to know of other minds and if they experience qualia (like we cannot know if machines have quali) , we cannot say other people think. (Turing, 1950)
		See [[Solipsism]]
	A2: The machine can easily mimic thinking responses 
		A2: But here aren't [[Turing]] and jefferson working on two different definitions of thinking? 

### Machinic Unoriginality
"The Analytical Engine has no pretensions originate to anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it perform to"
	A2: Does this also not apply to humans?
	A2: Does AI not already do this?
	A2: [[Turing]] There is nothing new under the sun, everything is a synthesis or disjunction of everything else. (Turing, 1950)
