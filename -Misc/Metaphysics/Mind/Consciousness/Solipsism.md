There are two forms of solipsism he wants to distinguish. In the first, inconsiderate form the solipsist says that the “only real thing is my experience; in the second, considerate forms he says “nothing is real for anybody, but what he experiences.” [Moore on Wittgentein](https://www.truthandpower.com/from-moores-lecture-notes-to-wittgensteins-blue-book/)

# Solipsism

## Conscious Intractability
Given some dualist conception, we cannot truly know whether or not someone else is conscious. Since consciousness cannot be empirically measured or cannot be understood by human judgement, I would just have to take it at your word that you are conscious. It would be impossible for me to prove otherwise.

# A2 Solipsism

## [[Wittgenstein]]'s Argument Against Solipsism
See [[The Blue and Brown Books]] (but only the blue book)
In order to be able to create the concept of a 'cogito', you need to have the public concept of a 'cogito.' A private entity cannot create the concept of self-consciousness as it relies first and foremost on language, a public tool. (need citation in blue book)
	[[Sovereignty of Good]], loc 319

[[Nagel]] brings up this argument and discussion in [[The Possibility of Altruism]] (106) to defend his point against [[Egoism (Action Theory)]].

## [[Ockham’s Razor]] 
It is a much simpler explanation that everyone else has a mind than that only *you* have a mind. It requires less explanatory power to explain an exception than to apply it to a whole.
	Related to Premise 8 of  [[Strawson]]'s argument for [[Panpsychism]]

## Practical Argument Against Solipsism
Why the hell are you telling me about solipsism if you dont actually believe Im hearing it?

## [[Leibniz]]'s Theory of Identity Applied
See [[Wittgenstein]]
When someone says it is only I who experience, what exactly do you mean? Are you truly the same person you were 20 years ago? What is the distinction?
	Digression: #Questions How does Leibniz' theory of identity clash with [[Nagel]]'s view on nonfundamentalism in [[Altruism & Egoism]]? Would they not reinforce each other?
