# Conscious Emergentism

Consciousness emerges from nonconscious parts

## Argument from Analogy to Liquid
"Some say that consciousness is an emergent property as well, that it arises when constituent parts – neurons, sense organs and the like – are organized with sufficient complexity. If so, the emergence of consciousness would be a  “strong” emergence. The new quality, consciousness, would not be reducible to the system’s constituent parts; the whole would be greater than the sum of its parts."

# Panpsychism
See [[Spinoza]], [[Whitehead]]

Guiding Questions:  
Does consciousness necessitate freewill? Determinism?
Do physical phenomena create subjective experiences? How is it translated from material to immaterial?
How does something get consciousness?
Where did consciousness come from?
Will consciousness ever end?
Is everything equally conscious?

## Panpsychism

### [[Strawson]]'s Argument for Panpsychism
0.	Reality is made of only one type of stuff. There is only one ultimate category that applies to everything. We call this view Monism.
1.	Everything real has a material aspect. That is, every instance of the one type of stuff of which reality is made is observable from an external, publicly-available point of view.
2.	Our own experience, directly observable only from the point of view of the one who is having it, is indisputably real.
3.	Hence, at least some of reality has an experiential aspect as well as a material aspect.
4.	There is no radical emergence of experience from non-experiential stuff. The experiential aspect of something does not radically emerge from the material aspect. (By “radical” I mean strong, as opposed to weak, emergence. See discussion below.)
	This is proven by [[Leibniz]] in the next section, 'Micropsychism'
5.	Hence, experience is as fundamental to reality as matter.
5.	Experience is fundamental to reality.
6.	What is real is ultimately made up of very tiny elements; these are its fundamental constituents.
7.	Hence, at least some fundamental constituents of reality are intrinsically and irreducibly experiential as well as material in nature. For short, we call this idea “Micropsychism.”
7.	Micropsychism is true.
8.	The assertion that all fundamental constituents of reality are experiential as well as material is simpler than and preferable to the assertion some are and some are not. 
	Rests upon [[Ockham’s Razor]]
9.	Hence, all fundamental constituents of reality are intrinsically and irreducibly experiential in nature as well as material. For short, we call this “panpsychism.”

### The Combination Problem
"Take a hundred of them (feelings), shuffle them and pack them as close together as you can (whatever that may mean); still each remains the same feeling it always was, shut in its own skin, windowless, ignorant of what the other feelings are and mean. There would be a hundred-and first-feeling there, if, when a group or series of such feelings were set up, a consciousness belonging to the group as such should emerge. And this 101st feeling would be a totally new fact; the 100 feelings might, by a curious physical law, be a signal for its creation, when they came together; but they would have no substantial identity with it, nor it with them, and one could never deduce the one from the others, nor (in any intelligible sense) say that they evolved it. (James 1981: 160)b"
	Passage from [SEP](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/panpsychism/#CombProb)

### The Subject-Summing Problem
Built from basis of Mereological Nihilism or Mereological Pluralism
I have a unique experience that excludes certain other experiences (Bob's mental state) What line can be drawn from *my* unique mental state and Bob's unique mental state? If what creates consciousness is an aggregate of simples behaving in a certain way, why does the aggregate stop right outside of my skin?
	Building on this [[Goff]] argues that we can conceive of a “micro-experiential zombie”, defined as a creature that is:
	-   Physically indiscernible from an actual human being,
	-   Such that each of its micro-level parts has conscious experience.
	-   Such that no macro-level part of the organism has conscious experience.
		Passage from [SEP](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/panpsychism/#CombProb)
In essence, under panpsychism or micropsychism, how do we make sense of a subject like you or me?
	A2: Charles [[Hartshorne]] has made the distinction between “compound” and “composite” individuals, which is roughly the distinction between what is living and what is not. A compound individual is one which (or who), on a macro level, has a “dominating unit,” an inclusive locus of experience, a single subject that unifies the experiences of its components into a coherent whole. Non-living things, although made up of actual ultimates that each have a mental or experiential aspect, have no such unification of experience. Hartshorne calls them “composite” rather than “compound.

# Micropsychism

## Micropsychism
### [[Leibniz]]' Argument
Perception is inexplicable on material grounds. If there were an AI that had a motion sensor for example, we shouldn't believe it is truly perceiving motion. When opening a machine, we only see parts that work in conjunction, but never a part that is the "perception" part. Thus, it is in simple substance perception is found, not in any collection of things ([[The Monadology]], 17)

Perceptions can only come from other perceptions, as motion can only come from other motion.
	This means that we had perception before we were born, we just were not cognizant of it. ([[The Monadology]], 23)

#### God

#### Spirit
Most perfect beings that have no friction with eachother, their existences are symbiotic. The most perfect possible state for an intellligent soul to reach

#### Intelligent Souls

#### Nonintelligent Souls
Mere things
Includes nonhuman animals

## A2 Micropsychism

### Problem of Permanence
See [[Kant]]
If the soul is substance and cannot be represented as the predicate for another thing, permanence of the soul must also be proven as permanence is the quality which renders the idea of substance in experience meaningful. When we say a soul is permanent, we mean that a soul is eternal and unchanging.  Since this hasnt been proven, and because it seems impossible to be proven, micropsychism is false.
