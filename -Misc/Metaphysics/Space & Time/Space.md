What is Space?

## Space is an actual thing
#WIP 
	A2: [[Kant]]: This cannot be the case as space is a prerequisite for thing-ness. A thing cannot be a thing without space, so clearly spatiality *precedes* existence as a thing.

## Space is a property of things
#WIP
	A2: [[Kant]]: This cannot be the case as we cant think about space-sans-thing
	"Pure space is not at all a quality of things in themselves, but a form of our sensuous faculty of representation" [[Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics]] , 35

## Space is a filter of the Intuition
See [[Kant]]
