[[My Stance]] on mathematical realism: Either Full Blooded Platonism is true or fictionalism is true. Anything else is metaphysically or epistemically contradictory. The strongest argument for mathematical platonism is Quine's [[Indispensability Argument]], and the strongest for mathematical antiplatonism is [[Ockham’s Razor]]. Between these, I dont know what to choose

"""
As a note, this and [[Mathematical Antiplatonism]] should be put on one page if following the style guidelines in [[Pro-Con TEMP]], but since each is so long it wouldn't make sense to do so.

# Antiplatonic Positive Case

**As Albert Einstein once said, “The series of integers is obviously an invention of the human mind, a self-created tool which simplifies the ordering of certain sensory experiences.” Like Einstein, today I stand before you on the negative to propose that mathematics was invented, not discovered.

A few quick things before we start

First, Definitions:

“DISCOVER: Definition in the Cambridge English Dictionary.” DISCOVER | Definition in the Cambridge English Dictionary, dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/discover.

Discover: According to the Cambridge definition: “to [find](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/find) [information](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/information), a [place](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/place), or an [object](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/object), [especially](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/especially) for the first [time](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/time)”

Platonism: The idea that mathematical objects exist independently of humans.

Math: Numbers and their relations

  

Next, Values:

Since this is a question of being, truth and Ockham's Razor are the only things we ought to value for this round.

C1: [[Ockham’s Razor]]

This is the biggest reason to vote NEG. According to Ockham, “Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions, and equal explanatory power should be chosen” Simply, Ockham's Razor is the contention that if we can make our worldview simpler without sacrificing our understanding of the world, that's a good thing. All people who study this branch of philosophy value Ockham’s razor, so we ought to as well.

An example is that i could believe there is an invisible monkey that wanders around my house that i can't perceive, but since this belief doesn't explain the world better than a world in which this monkey doesn't exist, we should reject the idea of the monkey in the first place. He doesn't need to exist for me to understand the world, so I should eliminate him from my beliefs. In this case, numbers are the monkey. 

Since the NEG has the fewest assumptions, since the AFF assumes numbers exist, and NEG the same exact explanatory power, you should be voting for the NEG here, based on this contention alone. 

In order to win this round, my opponent has to prove that nominalism can't have the same explanatory power. I'll explain why it does in the next contention. 

  

C2: Fictionalism

The idea that math isn't innately true can be a bit scary, but let me assure you that the implications form the NEG ought to raise no concern. Going forward, I'll be adopting a branch of fictionalism.

 Basically, I'll be saying that 3+4=7 is just as true as Harry Potter is in the house of Gryffindor. The way these are true is with a pseudo-preface. In the story of Harry Potter, Harry Potter belongs to the house of Gryffindor. In the story of arithmetic, 3+4 is 7. It's a fictional story that has turned out to be pretty useful. ([[Names]])


Today, I’ll be defending the position of Fictionalism. Because it is possible to get rid of the need for abstraction within mathematics as proven by Hartry Field, we can easily shift our perspective of mathematics away from some holy structure that exists beyond proof to simply a language that tends to be helpful for human development. The truth value of mathematical statements doesn’t actually matter, but what matters is how we use algorithms to develop tools to help humanity thrive. Just like literally every other language in the world, it is an invented tool to help us navigate our environment. Just like we still use Classical mechanics to build cars and bridges, despite it being disproven on the quantum scale, the truth of mathematical statements isn’t what we care about.

If anyone wants Field’s full process of his nominalization of mathematics, I would be happy to explain later or send the file into the chat. Now that we've covered some bases for why NEG has the same explanatory power, let's move to why Platonism, or the AFF position is untenable.

 Since we use the words “longer than” “larger than” “Is the same size as” and basic addition, such as “2 of x is as long as y” we can thus derive all of the axioms of Peano arithmetic, and thus all of our axioms of math, just using basic already nominalized language. Because all math needs physical units to refer to, those just stand in place during every equation. 

  

According to philosopher Hartry Field, mathematics can be nominalized, and still completely work. ≻ means is longer than, ~ means is as long as, ° means concatenation operation (the thing that links objects together) Hartry Field in his book Science Without Numbers provided a way to make math still useful in a non-platonic sense. His equation of nominalization proves that math is still able to explain itself, even without the existence of existing numbers. His method was fairly simple: He found that we can use already nominalized language such as “larger than” “is the same length as” and a linking operative, to get to where we are now in math. (The symbols of ≻, ~, and °, respectively, translated to >, =, and + because they each maintain the important properties of ≻, ~, and °) in other words, imagine boat A and boat B. We can nominallistically say that Boat A is longer than Boat B, just by using our senses. This is our conception of >. If they were the same length, another thing we can empirical senses, then that creates our conception of =. The addition is a bit trickier, but can be done. From here, we can select a unit object, say the king’s foot, and use it relative to the boats. Thus we can say that Boat A ~ 50u, (which can be translated as u°u°u°u°… °u), or 50u’s lined up next to each other. Using this, we can create simple axioms of math to rest our foundation of math on, and create equations with. (50 x 1 = 50).

  
  

C3: [[Benacerraf]]’s Epistemic Problem

  

This is a pure rational proof, so in order to actually win this round, my opponent has to tell me exactly which premise they disagree with. 

P1: Human beings exist entirely within spacetime.

P2: If there are any mathematical objects, they exist outside of spacetime.

P3: If there exist any mathematical objects, then humans could not attain any knowledge of them

P4: Humans have mathematical knowledge

C1: Mathematical Platonism is incorrect.
  

Simplified, Benaceraff points out that since humans and [[Abstract Objects]], such as numbers, exist on a different plane, it would be impossible to gain knowledge of them. If we can only gain knowledge through that which we can perceive, and I can't perceive “1” how can we have knowledge of it as an object? 

  

We can only “discover” that which we can see touch and taste, and we cannot see touch or taste the number “1,” it is impossible for math to be discovered. 

  
  
  

C4: [[Benacerraf]]’s Nonuniqueness Problem

  

Again, Benacerraf challenges the affirmative with a formal proof, this time with the non uniqueness problem. In other words, how do we actually know which mathematical system is the correct one, objectively? 

One example is euclidean and non-euclidean geometry. Both fields of mathematics work under different sets of axioms, and thus there exist two different “maths.” Both cannot be true, because according to the AFF, there's only one objectively true answer. The challenge for my opponent is to tell me how exactly we can know which geometry is the correct one? Mathematical paradoxes such as this exist, and to have any truth value to mathematics they can't exist in the first place.

Another example is string theory and loop quantum gravity, which are two quantum theories derived from mathematics that cannot both exist. According to my opponent who believes in objectivity within math, it would be impossible to reconcile this contradiction in math. 

If this is true, then math has absolutely zero objectivity, and thus no truth value. My opponent needs this objectivity in order to make truth statements, so my opponents run into a self made contraction where they believe 2+2=4 is both objectively true and not true.

  
  
  

Here is another formal proof which I would like an answer to. My opponent must reject at least one premise in order for anything they say to count against this point. 

P1: Zermelo and Von Neumann’s set theories are mutually exclusive.

P2: Both set theories are internally consistent, and thus true

P3: In order to have objectivity to math, there can only be one objective system of math

P4: Objectivity in math is the only way to account for truth value

C1: Either Z or VN is incorrect, and my opponent has to tell me which one, and why

OR

C2: Both set theories are false, and thus something derived from math isn't true

OR

C3: Both are true, and there is no objectivity to math.

  

Thus, because the NEG makes the least amount of assumptions and cuts out excess baggy ontology, AND avoids benacerraf's two objections, the NEG ought to win this ballot

## Platonism = Discovery

1.  This misrepresents Platonism and Neoplatonism as an idea. One does not necessarily follow the other. Just because math exists independently of humans, that doesn't mean it was discovered. Even if you prove platonism is true, that doesn't actually answer the resolution. For example, humans could have invented mathematics and still have independently existing [[Abstract Objects]]. Picture a chair. Humans invented chairs, but they still exist independently of us. Likewise, humans could have invented mathematics but have numbers exist independently of us. Basically, you can drop any point of contention on their side relating to platonism because it can work under my world as well.
    

## Problem of the Application of Mathematics

“Math is everywhere, it's in rabbit populations, fibonacci sequences, and water drops so it has to be true”

1.  The biggest rebuttal to this argument is that the AFF can't solve this either. Even if we grant that math is objectively true, that doesn't mean we know it correlates with our world. As Mark Balaguer put it “If I have a theory of Mars that makes indispensable use of facts about Joe Biden, I cannot account for this by merely pointing out that all my claims about Biden are true. I have to say what Joe Biden has to do with Mars.” Any argument the AFF uses to respond here, I could just use on my side as well. I turn the challenge on the AFF to tell me how these [[Abstract Objects]] explain the physical world. As I have already said, abstract numbers are inert, or in other words don't cause anything or have physical properties, and aren't affected by anything, I don't see how this furthers your argument. Because the number 1 as an abstract object does not have physical properties, it can't possibly actually affect anything, and thus it couldn't be applicable. In a word, since you can't touch, taste, feel, smell a number, how can math even be applied to the physical world if it's an [[Abstract Objects]]?
    

  

## Fibonacci

“The fibonacci sequence is everywhere in nature! Therefore there has to be some driving objective math behind it”

  

1.  [See “A2 Problem of the Application of Mathematics”](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15g_ddS3K7ibUGADbII8EsEWPrQ8dzD5QM0PFfJTm6_I/edit#heading=h.dw65w35nt9l)
    
2.  Because abstract numbers are inert, or in other words don't cause anything, and aren't affected by anything, I don't see how this furthers your argument. Did numbers cause plants to grow in this way, or rabbits to reproduce in this method? How specifically does this link to paltonism or realism?
    
3.  The reason the fibonacci sequence exists in nature is because it is the most efficient usage of space or time. Of course natural selection would choose it. Our language of math is simply a way of categorizing this series of numbers that would exist either way.
    

  

## Math’s Predictability

“Newton ‘discovered’ the planetary orbit down to a hundred thousanth of a decimal before we had the means to empirically test it”

1.  It makes complete sense that this is the case. Consistent patterns tend to arise in nature, because all physical objects follow the same physical laws. You're trying to make it seem like my position was that Newton randomly guessed planet orbits, but that's not my position at all. It makes sense that we can figure out the gravity or orbit of another planet if we know (which we do) our own orbit or our own gravity. Math isn't a guess pulled from thin air, but a science based on patterns. Since our world has consistent laws within it, the same patterns will arise time and time again.
    


Animals can Count

“Animals also use math, so therefore its discovered”

1.  This doesnt actually prove discovery. With just as much gusto and correctness as my opponent I could exclaim that animals invented mathematics. Even if I grant that some animals do use mathematics, it is the burden of my opponent to explain how we know that animals discover mathematics, not invent it for themselves. An analogous example would be that since apes also use tools sometimes that tools themselves are discovered, not invented. This is clearly absurd. Just because another species does something similar to what we do doesn’t mean that we automatically “discover” that thing.
    
2.  If anything, this idea helps my side more than my opponents. From this point, it is clear that evolution played a helping hand in the formation of mathematics. From this, it seems that the organisms that could invent mathematics were better able to survive and reproduce, leading to more mathematics in the world. Without the development of the brain in these creatures, which is invented, the mathematics could not exist. 
    

## A2 [[Quine]]’s [[Indispensability Argument]]

“The only way we can account for truth is with platonism”


1.  Quine's biggest problem is that he cannot account for the vast majority of mathematics. Since Quine's criterion for "valid mathematical theories" is that it contributes to emperical science, a vast vast majority of mathematics is not valid nor true. According to Linnebo, only a small amount of set theory and higher order mathematics actually contribute to emperical science. Thus in my opponents world, we would have to wait for empirical tests to prove mathematics, which isnt how we ever do mathematics. We have to remember that our job a philosophers isnt to change the way we do mathematics, but rather describe the way in which it works. Quine would be changing the entire field in this way. 
    
2.  According to philosopher Penelope Maddy A LOT of quantum theorists aren't even committed to the existence of what their math leads to, such as string theory.
    
3.  According to Penelope Maddy again, Scientists still work with faulty math. Classical Mechanics has been disproven at the quantum scale, but many mathematicians still use it because it's useful for non quantum calculations.
    
4.  It is dispensable. According to philosopher Hartry Field, mathematics can be nominalized, and still completely work. ≻ means is longer than, ~ means is as long as, ° means concatenation operation (the thing that links objects together) Hartry Field in his book Science Without Numbers provided a way to make math still useful in a non-platonic sense. His equation of nominalization proves that math is still able to explain itself, even without the existence of existing numbers. His method was fairly simple: He found that we can use already nominalized language such as “larger than” “is the same length as” and a linking operative, to get to where we are now in math. (The symbols of ≻, ~, and °, respectively, translated to >, =, and + because they each maintain the important properties of ≻, ~, and °) in other words, imagine boat A and boat B. We can nominallistically say that Boat A is longer than Boat B, just by using our senses. This is our conception of >. If they were the same length, another thing we can empirical senses, then that creates our conception of =. The addition is a bit trickier, but can be done. From here, we can select a unit object, say the king’s foot, and use it relative to the boats. Thus we can say that Boat A ~ 50u, (which can be translated as u°u°u°u°… °u), or 50u’s lined up next to each other. Using this, we can create simple axioms of math to rest our foundation of math on, and create equations with. (50 x 1 = 50). Since Field has proven that the fictionalists can explain math just as easily (if not easier than the platonists), my 1st contention on Ockham's Razor stands strong.
    
5.  According to Penelope Maddy again, “...We treat a section of the Earth's surface as flat rather than curved when we compute trajectories; we assume the ocean to be infinitely deep when we analyze the wave on a surface; we use continuous functions to represent quantities like energy, charge, and angular momentum, which we know to be quantized; we take liquids to be continuous substances in fluid dynamics, despite atomic theory” Therefore, is it reasonable to believe that the earth is flat and that the ocean is infinitely deep since these are indepennsible to math as it stands? Obviously not. Math is a tool, not a holy scripture.
    
6.  According to Stanford Encyclopedia, Mark Balaguer’s argument can be summarized as follows: If there are any such things as abstract objects, then they are causally inert. But given this, it follows that the truth of empirical science depends upon two sets of facts that hold or don’t hold independently of one another. One of these sets of facts is purely platonistic and mathematical, and the other is purely physical (or more precisely, purely anti-platonism). Since these two sets of facts hold or don’t hold independently of one another, functionalists can maintain that (a) there does obtain a set of purely physical facts of the sort required here, i.e., the sort needed to make empirical science true, but (b) there doesn’t obtain a set of purely platonistic facts of the sort required for the truth of empirical science (because there are no such things as [[Abstract Objects]]). Basically, balaguer makes his way out of this by saying that it doesn't matter if math is correct or not. When looking at a physical system, even under the AFF world, there stands to be a world of mathematical facts and physical facts that are both true, independently. Thus, even disregarding the first “mathematical fact” we can still have access to the physical fact of the matter, which is the only thing we need.
    

## Problem of Objectivity

“Math needs to be objective to be useful”

  
1.  Math does not need to be true in order for empirical science to be accurate. These are two different things. “A stone is on the hill” can still be true even if mathematics didn't exist. Math is a tool used to understand the world, and if it helps us do that, then it succeeds. That's all math tries to do, is make sense of the empirical world.
    
2.  The NEG does in fact have objectivity. If we imagine mathematic practice as “what would be true if these numbers existed,” then there would still be objectivity within my framework.
    
3.  The AFF doesn't have objectivity, as I have already said. Since neither the Zermelo or Von Neumann set theories are distinguishably false in comparison, their so-called objectivity has its own contradictions. Thus platonism isn't objective either. Basically, objectivity works against the affirmation because it is impossible to choose either Euclidean or NonEuclidean geometry as true. You can't be objective and have both be true.
    
4.  See A2 Quine Putnam
    
5.  Field [1989] responded to the worry about objectivity and correctness by claiming that the difference between '4 is even' and '5 is even' is analogous to the difference between 'Oliver Twist grew up in London' and 'Oliver Twist grew up in L.A.' In other words, the difference is that '4 is even' is part of a certain well-known mathematical story, whereas '5 is even' is not. Field expressed this idea by saying that while neither '4 is even' nor '5 is even' is true simpliciter, there is another truth predicate. 'is true in the story of mathematics'-that applies to '4 is even' but not to '5 is even'. And this, functionalists might say, is why '4 is even' is correct-or jictionalistically correct-and '5 is even' is not. 
    

  

## Problem of Uniform Semantics

“If we grant scientific realism, we can't have uniform semantics that apply to two different truth values”

1.  In an attempt to agree with the truth-value assignments that are usually displayed in mathematical discourse, the mathematical fictionalist introduces a fictional operator: ‘According to mathematical theory M…’. Such an operator, however, changes the semantics of mathematical discourse. Applied to a true mathematical statement, at least one that the platonist recognizes as true, the result will be a true statement—even according to the mathematical fictionalist. 
    
2.   Right now, you are talking to a scientific anti-realist, meaning that I reject the first premise, and thus the conclusion. Science, just like mathematics, is done not in pursuit of truth, but in pursuit of net happiness. Nobody does science specifically only for truth, but developments that could further humanity. Thus, we DO have a uniform semantic for truth in both cases: we use “True” to mean that which creates a theory to best live the human experience.
    

## Deductivism

“Understanding the terms of numbers, we can deduct mathematical sentences with an “if/then” format”

1.  The problem with deductivism, although it sounds appealing prima facie it all lies on the central if. IF x then y. This theory sort of dodges the question of this debate because another way to reword it is “if we know x is true, then y” but we don't even know if x is true objectively, and doesn't answer how we get our axioms. If x is true is what we're debating right now. 
    
2.  As Field put it in his work Science without Numbers, Mathematical truth is not logical truth because the existence claims of math are not logically true. If they were, we wouldn't even be having this debate right now because it would be just as trivial as the phrase “all bachelors are unmarried”. In order to buy deductivism, I would need a formal proof of their existence and a philosophical source. The existence is what we are debating.
    
3.  According to the deductivists, Axioms -> Theory is true, and Axioms and Theory is not true. Nothing is true in itself, so this fundamentally can't apply to anything in the real world. Put more plainly, the deductivist believes that if the axioms are true then the theory follows, but they make no truth statement about axioms or theories in the first place, effectively dodging the question and the debate
    

## All Inventions are Discoveries

1.  This is a hella abusive contention. For this, we can look at framers' intent. Do you really think the framers of this debate wanted us to debate like this? Do you really think they would have put out this resolution, all the while seeing this contention as a legitimate rebuttal to my position? This is a complex and nuanced debate, and it is completely disingenuous to write off everything I have to say with “lol yeah but it's all discovered though.”
    
2.  Even then, even though he relied on technology of the past, Alexander Graham Bell still invented the telephone. His unique idea led to a new creation that had not previously existed. If humans did not exist, telephones wouldn't either. Thus it is an invention by any sane definition.
    

  
## Question Begging

1.  This begs the question in so many different ways. This is complete circular logic, and doesn't add anything to the debate. 
    
2.  This is a post hoc rationalization. We can only categorize 24 apples as 24 because we have the experience of arithmetic ingrained into us culturally. The idea that “Newton invented calculus” or “Newton discovered calculus” is exactly what we are debating.
    

  

[[Structuralism]]

“Numbers aren't things, but positions within a structure”

1.  This worldview does not avoid Benacerraf's 2 objections to platonism
    

1.  First, the identification problem. According to Burgess15, structuralism still faces Benacerraf's identification problem. This is because structuralism never actually chooses an objectively correct set theory. It is a red herring to the question.
    
2.  Second, it dodges the epistemological problem. Even if we grant that numbers are nothing but positions within a structure, how do we know the ordering we have of this structure is correct? What could possibly ground this besides our own human intuitions?
    

3.  Most importantly though, structuralism remains agnostic on the side of invention or discovery. There are people who believe we invent mathematical structures and people who believe we discover mathematical structures. The existence of structuralism does not necessarily lead to one side nor the other: it is merely a different way to observe mathematics around us. 
    

  

Logicism

“Math is reduced to Logic”

1.  According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, there are [11 different problems](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logicism/#SumProForLog) with this view, and 11 separate reasons to vote NEG. I'll give the 4 best for the sake of brevity though.
    

1.  First is [[Frege]]’s Julius Caesar Problem. Under logicism, how are we not to be sure that “Julius Caesar” is not a number. Put more directly, how can one show, on such an account, that no number is a concrete individual? What makes 2 a number, but not me? What is a number??
    
2.  According to Kurt [[Godel]]’s incompleteness theorem, Russell, the inventor of logicism, failed at his task of reducing math to logic because it is impossible to construct a complete and consistent formal language to derive all of math with. This is the main reason logicism is not held today.
    
3.  Second is [[Benacerraf]]’s Epistemological problem but stronger: My opponent is saying that just as Socrates is a man, we “know” that 2+2=4. I can touch and smell and taste socrates (uwu), but i don't have access to any [[Abstract Objects]] such as numbers
    
4.  Most importantly, “mathematical truth is not logical truth because the existence claims of mathematics are not logically true” (74). In essence, logicism buries this hidden premise of “mathematical objects exist independently,” which is exactly what we are debating. It is not necessarily true that numbers exist independently of us, unlike socrates, and so first my opponents have to prove this crucial step before they can access their impacts.
    

## Full Blooded Platonism / Plenitudinous Platonism

“All consistent mathematical theories are true”

1.  See my contention about Ockham's Razor. Even if we buy this argument, you should turn to my side because this theory and my theory are nearly identical, but mine has less complications in our understanding of the world, and thus we should accept mine.
    
2.  According to large number cardinal theories, consistency is not a value for truth. Just because a mathematical theory is consistent, that doesn't mean it has any truth value whatsoever, so you should vouch for my argument here instead. For example, if i make the statement “all cats are black, sam is a cat, sam is black” then although it is consistent, isn't true. NOT all cats are black.
    
3.  Moreover, beyond this basic claim, consistency is not enough for truth because Kurt [[Godel]] already proved so in his second incompleteness theorem. In this, he claimed that any mathematical theory cannot prove its own consistency. Therefore, one cannot actually prove that a mathematical system is in fact consistent, and thus one cannot prove that the system is true.
    

  

[[Socrates]]’ Slave Boy

“The slave boy in Socrates’ story knew math without formal education, therefore math is innate”

1.  I could begin to buy your argument about Socrtes’ slave boy if it were the fact that the boy had existed in a vacuum. Unfortunately, he did not. Thus the thought experiment in no way proves that mathematics was innate, because the boy was already using measurement, time, etc before he was asked a trig question by Socrates. With just as much credibility and gusto, I could use this story to support my side.
    
2.  Secondly, and most damning, the idea that mathematics is innate to humans supports the NEG side most. If we define invention as “that which is created by humans,” and if human brains, the location of mathematical objects, are invented by our parents, the objects within the brain were also invented if they were innate. Mathematics was invented by your mother, and her mother, ad infinitum if mathematics is innate. Vote NEG for this turn.
    

Problem of Infinity

“Infinite mental nor physical objects could possibly exist”

1.  This problem is easily solved. If we imagine infinity not as an actual infinite plentitude of actual objects, and instead see infinity as an idea representing infinite objects, then infinity makes sense. Put plainly: infinite things may not exist, but we can conceptualize hypothetically something that represents infinity.
    
2.  This problem isn't solved in the affirmation either. The issue here is it would be impossible for a human to conceptualize infinity as a set of numbers, and thus it you shouldnt be voting on this issue
    
3.  Refer back to my problem of epistemology
    

# Anti Platonic Realism

## Psychologism

“Mathematical objects exist in our mind, and are real” 

1.  This is no different from my view of fictionalism, I believe they exist in our mind. Does this mean anything we think up is real, such as unicorns? If not, what makes them ontologically different from numbers?
    

## [[Kant]]

“Numbers and math are a priori knowledge, so they are true even without experience”

1.  Hate to be the one to tell ya bud, but Kant disagreed with this. He thought that math was a posteriori (the opposite of a priori). This basically means that Kant believed mathematics was invented by humans. Because mathematics only resides in the brain, according to Kant, mathematics is invented by humans. For example, let’s take an arm for example. An arm is invented by a human, the mother of the child. Therefore, the products of this arm are also invented. The same logic applies to the brain. As the brain was invented by the mother, the products of the brain, ie math, are also invented. Therefore Kant believed math was invented, thus turning my opponent’s entire case
    

## [[J.S. Mill]]

“Math is an empirical study. We discover empirical things, so we discover math”

1.  This is untenable for a LOT of reasons. The first being that in order for our conception of infinity to exist, there has to be an infinite number of objects. Since there is only a limited number of matter in the universe, infinity can't exist, and our number system would end abruptly after a very certain number of atoms, and nothing else could possibly exist beyond it.
    
2.  If math is an empirical study, I would be able to falsify it somehow. How would I go about falsifying math? (see [[Rationalism, Empiricism, & Idealism]])
    
3.  We only have direct empirical evidence of only a small fraction of the theories in math that we use. This means that we only have knowledge of a small number of theories. For example, we can empirically test 2+2=4, but for something like set theory or higher-order calculus, we have no empirical tests to prove or disprove it. Thus, under empiricism, things that mathematically hold such as set theory doesn’t mean truth.
    
4.  Most importantly, any empirical claim, any scientific claim, requires the use of statistic verification. Any respectable empirical science requires statistical significance. The important thing is though is that statistics is a branch of mathematics. Thus, following this, we need mathematic truth in order to validate mathematic truth! This is circular logic, and thus we cant buy my opponent's argument.
    
5.  Mathematical theories never face the “tribunal of experience.” An example is due to philosopher Michael Friedman who claims that (quote) “when the theory of relativity was subjected to empirical tests, the underlying mathematical theory of Riemannian  geometry never faced “the tribunal of experience” but was presupposed in order to formulate the theories that do” 
    
6.  Aggregates do not have a specific number attached to them, whereas sets do. Thus under the Millian framework, mathematical sets couldn't exist. Think of this another way. Maddy in essence takes on the completely indefensible Millian view that sets are aggregates of physical matter. While a set has a determinate amount of numbers, physical objects cannot. In other words, “3 eggs” isn't just “3 eggs.” It's billions of molecules, and trillions of atoms making up egg stuff. Each physical object *is* a massive amount of sets, or numbers, just by existing. 
    
7.  More technically, under mills view, the rank two set of {x,y} is exactly equivalent to the rank one set {{x,y}} in set theory. If Mill can't refute this, then he cannot account for the truth of higher order set theories such as the Zermelo set theory, which is consistent within our mathematical knowledge.
    

## Kitcher

“Mill’s view, except done by an ideal agent”

1.  Ideal agents don't exist. How is this different from fictionalism (My view)? You mentally construct someone to do the math that we cant empirically do. My view is that we construct a math system to do the math. Aren't these the same thing??? 
    
2.  If math is an empirical study, I would be able to falsify it somehow. How would I go about falsifying math?
    

# CounterBlocks

========================================================================

  

## Ockham's Razor

  

## Epistemological problem

  

### 1st Premise

  

### [[Godel]]

“Minds are not spatiotemporally located”

1.  Even if I grant that minds are not spatiotemporally, you still have not proved that our minds come in contact with mathematical objects in the realm outside of spatiotemporality. What is required here is a form of Cartesian dualism (the idea that the mind and body are entirely separate) that also somehow connects us to the mathematical world. My opponent needs to not only prove cartesian dualism but also that the mind and body link with mathematics specifically.
    
2.  “The notion of an information transfer is a causal spatiotemporal one; it makes sense only when the sender and receiver are both physical objects.” There is no evidence on the contrary.
    

  

### 2nd Premise

  

### Maddy

“Mathematical objects can be perceived sensually”

1.  Here, Maddy has to take one of the horns she has created for herself. Because she agrees that the Millian view is untenable, and agrees that that the epistemic problem also exists, she has to either say that the Millian view, which ill get into later, or the platonic view is wrong. Now she is in a territory in which math is both abstract and not at the same time. Maddy later gave up this view, considering how unsubstantiated it was.
    
2.  Maddy in essence takes on the completely indefensible Millian view that sets are aggregates of physical matter. While a set has a determinate amount of numbers, physical objects cannot. In other words, “3 eggs” isn't just “3 eggs.” It's billions of molecules and trillions of atoms making up egg stuff. Each physical object *is* an infinite amount of sets, or numbers.
    
3.  If it's empirical, it has to be falsifiable. There has to be some metric to which math can be falsified under the affirmative world. This isn't necessarily the best position for them, and I doubt they would accept the premise that math could be wrong.
    
4.  Nobody, even a trained mathematician can perceive transfinite and irrational numbers, so now the aff is in a weird position where some numbers exist and some don't. If so, how do we determine which is which exactly?
    
5.  Maddy explains that her epistemology can be justified by it's pragmatic use, but pragmatism doesn't necessarily mean it is true. See Quine’s Indispensability argument
    

  
  

### 3rd Premise

### Quine

See A2 Indispensability

  

### [[Kant]]

“Mathematics is true a priori, just like deductive reasoning is true a priori”

1.  Kant agreed that math is synthetic a priori knowledge, not analytic. By his definition, math is invented by humans based on our empirical surroundings.
    
2.  NCTI or No Contact Theory of Intuition does not work for platonists in answering this question. By definition, it's based on intuition. How do we know our intuition is correct? 
    
3.  [A2 Kant](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15g_ddS3K7ibUGADbII8EsEWPrQ8dzD5QM0PFfJTm6_I/edit#heading=h.f2ahijomc06o)
    

  

### Shapiro

  

### NTCI: Lewis and Katz

“We know math is true because it couldn't be any other way, deductively. It is necessarily true.”

1.  This begs the question and doesn't really solve my challenge. How do we know it's true? Even if math is necessarily true, how do we know that it's necessarily true in the first place? What evidence could they possibly give to support this?
    
2.  Not only this, but the claim of necessity actually hurts Lewis and Katz. By their logic, any claim that is deductively true means it's metaphysically necessary. That means the phrase “a purple hula hoop exists” is just as metaphysically necessary as 2+2=4. In other words, there cannot be a world in which a purple hula hoop does not exist. I don't see any reason why “an empty set exists” is metaphysically necessary and “a purple hula hoop exists” isn't, since they are both the same structure and follow the same logic. I'd argue both are equally trivial to our metaphysics, and neither should be counted as fundamental to our world.
    

### Hale and Wright

“We can prove knowledge of abstract by finding sentences with similar syntax about physical objects.”

1.  The theorems they use (D) The direction of a line is identical to the direction of line b and L) Line a is parallel to line b), yeah, are about abstract objects. I don't doubt that. That doesn't mean they are fundamentally true, even if they refer to abstract objects. That's like saying that “I live in a house” and “Sherlock lives in 221B” are syntactically similar, so they must both be true.  
    
2.  This just begs the question. Although it seems tenable prima facie, they just use math to justify math, which was proven impossible by Godel a little later with his incompleteness theorem. It's circular logic, and shouldn’t be bought. 
    

  
  
  

## Fictionalism

  

## Problem of Objectivity

“Someone can say that 1+2=4 and be correct >:(“

1.  Although this is technically correct, since we all use one standard arithmetic theory, it's not really a problem. We can just add the qualifier “In Peano Arithmetic, 1+2=3, and all other outcomes are incorrect” This is like saying that “If Sherlock Holmes doesn't exist, then someone can say he lives in 221C Bakers Street!!!” No. We can simply say that “In the fictional book series of Sherlock Holmes, Sherlock lives in 221B Baker’s Street, and all other places of residencies are wrong”
    

## Not actually anti platonic

“Well actually, sweaty, you rely on abstract ontological premises when you affirm fictionalism”

## Malament’s Objection

1.  I doubt either of us, being high school debate students, have the knowledge necessary to fully talk about principles of Quantum Mechanics, but if you want to go there, we can.
    
2.  Perhaps you can more fully explain the objection, but quantum theory remains as a relation to physical objects. My belief is that math is merely a descriptive language to refer to physical objects, so by rejecting this, do you believe everything about quantum mechanics has nothing to do with reality? This is put more technically by Mark Balaguer. The main objection brought up by Malament was that Hilbert Spaces were not nomanlizable, but we can simply say, as Mark Balaguer does, that the vectors in hilbert spaces represent physically real quantum properties, such as a “.5 strengthened z+ electron to be measured spin up in the x direction”**

# Random Notes

  
  

As [[Deleuze]] so eloquently put it: “The poisoned gift of Platonism is to have introduced transcendence into philosophy, to have given transcendence a plausible philosophical meaning”

  
Other paradoxes such as this are Zermello and Von Neumann set theories

  

The number 2 is represented by the von Neumann construction as {{},{{}}} while the Zermelo construction represents it as {{{}}}

  

Zermelo: “2”  is the set of numbers that contains the set that contains only the set containing nothing, as well as the set containing nothing

  

Von Neumann: “2” is the set containing the set containing the set of nothing

  
  

Take the Banach-Tarski paradox, in set-theoretical mathematics. Given a sphere, there exists a decomposition of the sphere into a finite number of disjoint subsets that can be put back together to create two identical spheres. This is only possible with an understanding of set theory as a model of understanding--obviously, one cannot take a beach ball and create two more... or can we? I ultimately yield to the negative's framework here. This paradox is a result of anti-intuition in reality, not mathematical models. There is no formal paradox here, it is simply against intuition. There is clearly a disconnect between set theory and reality, as the Banach-Tarski paradox is truly possible, but cannot be reflected in reality given the property of volume.

  

Just as String Theory and Loop Quantum Gravity cannot simultaneously be true models of our universe, set theories cannot co-exist in the mathematical universe. Providing a foundational model of mathematics that would be accepted by all mathematicians does not require that it be shown to exist in reality. I

  

p1 math is the study of numbers quantity and space.

p2 a discovery is something that exists, even without the existence of humans. 

p3 studies cannot exist without someone to do the studying.

c1 math cannot exist without someone to study numbers quantity and space.

  

Does 0 exist? If 0 is a placeholder for nothing, then nothing fundamentally exists, leading to a contradiction in terms. 

Greeks and Romans didn't believe 0 existed, now we do. How do we determine who is correct?

Does the same go for irrational, complex, and negative numbers? Since these don't have any correlation to the real world, how can we say they exist

  

“The series of integers is obviously an invention of the human mind, a self-created tool which simplifies the ordering of certain sensory experiences.” 
	Albert Einstein

  

The mathematical axioms are invented, but everything from there is discovered

By this logic, does Sherlock Holms and other fictional characters exist too in the world of forms?

Numbers are nothing but the symbol we create for them


Mathematical paradoxes exist, how do you account for the existence of paradoxes? No other real thing has paradoxes, so there's no way it could be real ([[Russell]]'s paradox for example). Math can't be objectively true if it has innate contradictions

  

Intuitionism

  

Identification problem: which mathematical theory is correct? Zormelo and Von Neumann both have set theories that contradict each other, but how do we actually determine which of the two is correct?

  
[[Plato]]nism is the view that (a) there exist abstract mathematical objects-objects that are non-spatiotemporal and wholly non-physical and non-mental-and (b) our mathematical theories provide true descriptions of such objects.

  

I could run that it theres is simply no fact of the matter if mathematical objects exist or not, thus favor occam's razor alone.


In other words, math is a descriptive language invented by humans. For example, we would want names for each of the different temperatures, so we could differentiate and make use of whether or not to wear a sweater outside. Instead of saying “it's feeling pretty Barbara outside” or “It's Johnathan in this room” we give them numerical names, in which a specific temperature correlates with a specific number. 

  
The idea that math isn't innately true can be a bit scary, but let me assure you that the implications form the NEG ought to raise no concern. Going forward, I'll be adopting a branch of fictionalism.

 Basically, I'll be saying that 3+4=7 is just as true as Harry Potter is in the house of Gryffindor. The way these are true is with a pseudo-preface. In the story of Harry Potter, Harry Potter belongs to the house of Gryffindor. In the story of arithmetic, 3+4 is 7. It's a fictional story that has turned out to be pretty useful.

  
In his seminal 1985 work, philosopher Hartry Field (backed by many modern philosophers such as Balaguer and Maddy) proposed the first way to nominalize math. He thought of math in terms of descriptions of patterns. Just like every other language in the world, mathematics is a way of describing our surroundings. We create and use mathematics because it is useful, but not necessarily true. We use mathematics as a representation of our world rather than some holy scripture. It is a human representation, a language, of physical phenomena above all else

If you want the full run down of Field’s process, ask me to go into more detail or my opponent can call for the card. Now that we've covered some bases for why NEG has the same explanatory power, let's move to why Platonism, or the AFF position is untenable.

 Since we use the words “longer than” “larger than” “Is the same size as” and basic addition, such as “2 of x is as long as y” we can thus derive all of the axioms of Peano arithmetic, and thus all of our axioms of math, just using basic already nominalized language. Because all math needs physical units to refer to, those just stand in place during every equation.
