# Is Metaphysics Possible?

## Yes

## No

### Argument from Noumena
See [[Kant]]
Metaphysics can only be a syntehtic a priori judgement, otherwise it is merely physics. Ergo, all we know of metaphysics is as a result of our own understanding. This means that teh thing-in-itself will never be understood unless via our own human filter.
Metaphysicians of the past have refused to ask the question *how* are a priori judgements possible, leading to dogma in the field.
	Q: How is nature possible in the material sense?
	A: By the constitution of our sensibility according to the Transcendental Aesthetic (See [[Space]], [[Time]])
	Q: How is nature possible in the formal sense
	A: By the constitution of our understanding according to laden a priori principles 
	"The understanding does not derive its laws a priori from, but prescribes them to, nature" ([[Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics]], 67)
	(See [[A Priori - A Posteriori]])



## What Should Metaphysics Be?
### [[Bergson]]
"If I wish to explain to someone who does not know Greek the simple impression that a line of Home leaves upon me, I shall give the translation of the line,  then comment on my translation, then I shall develop my commentary, and from explanation to explanation I shall get closer to what I wish to express; but I shall never quite reach it." [[Discourse on Metaphysics]], 5
	[[Bergson]] extends this analogy to draw the distinction between "analysis" and "intuition"
		**Analysis** - circling around an object, applying ideas to an object post hoc, is *relative* knowledge. Analysis is an asymptote to absolute knowledge: It can get infinitely close, but never reach it. [[Drawing 2022-08-22 17.03.04.excalidraw]]
			Follows the Concept -> Object vector, popular in [[Plato]]'s philosophy
		**Intuition** - enters an object, seeks to learn about the object in itself, is *absolute* knowledge.
			Follows the Object -> Concept vector, popular in [[Whitehead]]'s philosophy
		I *think* intuition = a priori ; analysis = a posteriori (see [[A Priori - A Posteriori]])
		[[Bergson]] thus defines metaphysics as "the science which claims to dispense with symbols." ([[Introduction to Metaphysics]], 8), and claims the study ought to escape the study of concepts.
			A painter substitutes the real image of Notre Dame in order to capture a schema of what it looked like to him. He takes the building out of context of the greater city, of the faults it may appear to have, and out of the time it existed in. The painting is a reconstruction of the reality of Notre Dame from one point of view. Metaphysicians do the same with Platonic concepts.
"Metaphysics has nothing in common with a generalization of experience, and yet it could be defined as the whole experience" ([[Introduction to Metaphysics]], 84)
