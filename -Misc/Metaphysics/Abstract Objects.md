See [[Plato]]

# Platonic Realism
Each soul has a platonic form of perfection, i.e, what the best form would be of an object. Leibniz claims that these forms (that he calls substantial form) are both acausal and differentiate depending on the type of soul an object has. For example, an intelligent soul's perfect form is that of a spirit. See [[What is Conscious]], [[Leibniz' Heriarchy.png]]

### [[Plato]]'s Argument
(Stump reconstruction)
1. Knowledge in infallible: If I know that x is y, then x must be y in every case.
2. Stability: if x is y in every case, then x must stay the same (at least in one respect)
3. Nothing in the sensible world stays the same (in any respect)
4. So, there is no knowledge of the things in the sensible world.
5. The only things that stay the same are things outside of the sensible world.
6. So, if there is knowledge, then it is of the things outside of the sensible world. 
7. There is knowledge.
	 This is where [[Greek Skepticism]] and [[Zen Buddhism]] get off
8. So, knowledge of things outside of the sensible world
9. The things outside of the sensible world are the forms
10. So, knowledge is of the forms
