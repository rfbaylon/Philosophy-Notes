## Ok... What the FUCK are dialectics

This is one of the best illustrations I have found:
"I shall never imagine how black and white intermingle if I have not seen grey, but I have no difficulty in understanding, once I have seen grey,  how one can envisage it from the double viewpoints of black and white" ([[Introduction to Metaphysics]], 80)
