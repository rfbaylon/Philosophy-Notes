“or use them (as ‘guinea pigs’!” ([Kagan, 2016, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TD5R58B6?page=1&annotation=RGCFE77P))

([Kagan, 2016, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) What about valuing dogs over pigs?

([Kagan, 2016, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) Not an A2 Veganism

([Kagan, 2016, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) Burden of proof on Kagan to prove there is something more to it

“Most of us, I am confident, would find this morally unacceptable. So at least some animals count, at least some of the time, to at least some degree. Putting the same point the other way around, humans aren’t the only creatures that count morally.” ([Kagan, 2016, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TD5R58B6?page=2&annotation=8AYDCEBH))

“other things being equal, human interests count more than corresponding animal interests.” ([Kagan, 2016, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TD5R58B6?page=2&annotation=7WD922AM))

([Kagan, 2016, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) Singer Accepts this aswell

([Kagan, 2016, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) Singer agrees!

([Kagan, 2016, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) An important part of Singer's argument is that it is based on unjustified discrimination of nonhuman animals.

“But consider the choice between doing the experiment on an animal and on a human with a comparable cognitive capacity” ([Kagan, 2016, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TD5R58B6?page=4&annotation=SNXRF4AA))

([Kagan, 2016, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) This makes it not speciesism though?

([Kagan, 2016, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) Is Kagan saying that given equal cognitive capacity, and equal everything, humans should still be worth more?

“So what matters is whether the two interests are alike in all the morally relevant ways.” ([Kagan, 2016, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TD5R58B6?page=5&annotation=UIP9BTEA))

“ntensity” ([Kagan, 2016, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TD5R58B6?page=5&annotation=ANC52YLJ))

“uration” ([Kagan, 2016, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TD5R58B6?page=5&annotation=ISBESBZA))

([Kagan, 2016, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) this seems correct, no?????

“Accordingly, when a speciesist claims that it is more important to avoid human pain than it is to avoid animal pain — even pains of equal duration and intensity — Singer insists that this is mere prejudice: ‘pain is pain’ he tells us” ([Kagan, 2016, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TD5R58B6?page=5&annotation=MVPGZF2X))

([Kagan, 2016, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) the burden is on the speciesist!

([Kagan, 2016, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) its your burden kagan

“Society” ([Kagan, 2016, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TD5R58B6?page=5&annotation=FCFLQJNJ))

([Kagan, 2016, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) Singer can incorporate that into intensity and duration!

([Kagan, 2016, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) dummy because the burden is on you

“It seems to me to be perfectly meaningful — and true! — to say that it is in the interests of a house plant, say, to be watered.” ([Kagan, 2016, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TD5R58B6?page=7&annotation=SUEW3D7Z))

([Kagan, 2016, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) begs question a bit.

“But I do think we have to recognize that one would be hard pressed to think of anything other than intuition to support the claim that the line between sentience and nonsentience is a morally significant one. So Singer himself is going to have to admit that the appeal to intuition carries force in questions like these.” ([Kagan, 2016, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TD5R58B6?page=7&annotation=FN8TRRI3))

([Kagan, 2016, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) I think the argument can be made

“Rather, the crucial point is that the racist or sexist accepts these beliefs despite the fact that the evidence for them falls far short of meeting the standards that they themselves would normally insist upon when it comes to evaluating this sort of empirical claim.” ([Kagan, 2016, p. 8](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TD5R58B6?page=8&annotation=SVHDDQ3Q))

([Kagan, 2016, p. 8](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) prejudice definition

“To see this, consider the following simple example: imagine that Lex Luthor is trying to kill Superman with some Kryptonite. Superman is in great pain, and may soon die. Now remember: Superman isn’t human. He isn’t a member of our biological species. But is there anyone (other than Lex Luthor!) who thinks this makes a difference? Is there anyone who thinks: Superman isn’t human, so his interests should count less than they would if he were? I doubt it. At any rate, there surely aren’t many. (Show of hands?) Examples like this could easily be multiplied. When ET, the extraterrestrial, is dying (in the movie of the same name) does anyone think, ‘Well, he isn’t a Homo sapiens, so all of this matters less’? I doubt it.” ([Kagan, 2016, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TD5R58B6?page=9&annotation=M446EGE4))

([Kagan, 2016, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) actually a really good point.  
could a potential counter be that he looks like a human, creating the prejudice. If he looked like a standard alien, i dont know if people would have the same intuition....

([Kagan, 2016, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) becauswe burden of proof lies on the one making a distinction

“intuitively attractive” ([Kagan, 2016, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TD5R58B6?page=12&annotation=A2ER9WV5))

([Kagan, 2016, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) is this the bar?

“Society” ([Kagan, 2016, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TD5R58B6?page=12&annotation=WIWJ92NB))

“According to personism your interests count more if you are a nonperson member of a person species or if you are a person — that is, regardless of whether your species is a person species. Since the intelligent dog is a person, its interests do count more.” ([Kagan, 2016, p. 13](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TD5R58B6?page=13&annotation=IWVZ8EZ3))

**([Kagan, 2016, p. 13](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) What would it take to make "dog" a "person species" ?**

“Impaired Martian Dogs objection: Suppose we discover that dogs were originally from another planet — Mars — where they are in fact persons, but that due to the different gravitational field here on Earth (which crucially affects brain development) dogs born here are not persons, and can no longer become ones. Still, it seems that Earth dogs are members of a person species, so according to personism their interests should count more, which is absurd.” ([Kagan, 2016, p. 13](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TD5R58B6?page=13&annotation=I7BYANS8))

“Obviously, this raises complicated questions about what, exactly, it would take for something to be a person species. But instead of pursuing these questions here” ([Kagan, 2016, p. 13](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TD5R58B6?page=13&annotation=NCBPKTQ3))

([Kagan, 2016, p. 13](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) BOOOOOOOOO

([Kagan, 2016, p. 14](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) BRO,,,, WHY do you grant it!

“the Plague objection, turns on the following thought: I have suggested that a given species is a person species if its ‘typical’ adult members” ([Kagan, 2016, p. 14](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TD5R58B6?page=14&annotation=SXLTFUW4))

“are persons. But that means — or so the objection goes — that whether a species is a person species depends on statistics: whether the majority of members of the given species turn out to be persons. Suppose, then, for example, that some incurable plague were to arise with the enduring result that most humans never develop into persons. Homo sapiens would cease to be a person species. Indeed, timelessly speaking, perhaps it never was one! And this in turn means that whether or not a given impaired human should count more will depend on whether such plagues ever come to pass. That seems implausible.” ([Kagan, 2016, p. 14](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TD5R58B6?page=14&annotation=LERLNRP6))

“The relevant question is not the statistical one of what most members of the species are like, but rather what the generic member of the species is like. The generic lion has hair, even if some disease leaves most lions bald. Similarly, the generic human is a person — even if some disease leaves few of us that way.” ([Kagan, 2016, p. 14](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TD5R58B6?page=14&annotation=IPQVSNFE))

##### **([Kagan, 2016, p. 14](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) this is a statistical appeal, generic and normal mean the same thing.  
If most lions didnt have hair, the weird lion would be the one with hair.**

“To see this point, consider the simple fact that one’s species is hardly the only group of which one is a member. Yo u , for example, are not only a member of a particular species, you are also a member of a particular genus, a particular family, a particular order, and so on, all the way up the taxonomic ranks. You are also, for that matter, a member of the group of people reading this essay, the group of people alive today, the group of people thinking about philosophy, and so on, and so forth. So what’s so special about one’s species?Why is this group the one particular group that we should focus on, when looking for morally relevant properties possessed by typical members of the group? Why should being a member of the relevant sort of species — and being a member of that type of group alone — particularly concern us?” ([Kagan, 2016, p. 14](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TD5R58B6?page=14&annotation=N9P6HP8R))

([Kagan, 2016, p. 14](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) good A2

##### “To be sure, the philosophy club is an artificial group, and arguably at least — the point is controversial — species (and higher groupings) are not.” ([Kagan, 2016, p. 15](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TD5R58B6?page=15&annotation=63MD4TZV))

([Kagan, 2016, p. 15](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) you cant just drop this bomb and not expand on it. What makes a grouping artificial????????????**

##### **“And in particular, as I have suggested, what membership in a person species reveals is that even an individual who is not in fact a person nonetheless could have been a person.” ([Kagan, 2016, p. 16](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TD5R58B6?page=16&annotation=287W8VBL))

##### ([Kagan, 2016, p. 16](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) could have been... in what modality? Is it logically possible that a rabbit could be a human. of course! is it biologically possible that a mentally disabled person could not have been that way... no! These are important clarifications.**

“not the biological fact that a given creature is a member of a person species, but rather the metaphysical fact” ([Kagan, 2016, p. 16](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TD5R58B6?page=16&annotation=S8EU7G82))

([Kagan, 2016, p. 16](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) why draw the line at metaphysical possibility?

([Kagan, 2016, p. 16](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) even then, there is a metaphysically possible world by which rabbits could be persons

([Kagan, 2016, p. 17](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) Kagans argument implies I could be the same person with entirely different genes

([Kagan, 2016, p. 19](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) kagan doesnt even believe this

“Furthermore, an adequate account of modal personism would presumably also want to make use of the idea that modal personhood comes in degrees: given two beings, both of whom could have been a person but neither of whom is a person, it might still be the case that one had been ‘closer’ to being a person than the other” ([Kagan, 2016, p. 19](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TD5R58B6?page=19&annotation=YPADIG89))

([Kagan, 2016, p. 19](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) how is this possible?

([Kagan, 2016, p. 20](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) This still isnt true as people value non-person dogs more than non-person pigs

“It is striking, for example, that when one regrets the fact that a conceivable good did not actually occur, the amount of regret that it is rational to have may depend on whether the good could have occurred, and on how remote that possibility was.” ([Kagan, 2016, p. 20](zotero://select/library/items/BIHES36H)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TD5R58B6?page=20&annotation=XVWZIPJX))
