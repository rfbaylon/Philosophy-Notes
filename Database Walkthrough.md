## What Is My Goal?

Disclaimers
### Disclaimer 1
If an argument exists in this data base, that does not mean I endorse it. If a belief does not exist in this data base, that does not mean I do not endorse it. I do my best to account for all sides of an argument and to try to accurately portray what a certain system believes, even if I disagree with it or even if I believe it to be bigoted. I will write down all arguments as honestly as possible, and attempt to engage with them as honestly as possible.

### Disclaimer 2
If there are A2s to certain arguments that I believe to be true, that doesnt mean that I dont endorse the conclusion.
If the following argument were presented, I would still write an A2.
~~~
1. My good friend John told me the Earth is round
2. Therefore the Earth is round
~~~
Even if it were the case that I took the conclusion to be true, I will still note and take seriously counterarguments to the argument presented.

In short, bad arguments can support good conclusions.

## What Are Tags?

#Cite - Citation needed
#WIP - Something that needs an (at most) 20 minute fix
#Questions - Tangential questions that arise that I don't yet have an answer to.
#MyArgument - An argument that I came up with myself. If something with this tag mirrors an already existing argument or idea, it is purely by coincidence.
#Quote - Cool quotes that could come in handy. This does not apply to all quotes as some are incredibly narrow.
#MyStance - Currently I am trying to write down my postive position among all of the arguments
