 Prop I Substance is prior in nature to its affections.

Substance is the base of all things.

For example, someone who believes that atoms are what the universe is made of believes that atomism is the substance of the universe. Atoms are the kind of stuff that everything is made of, making it the substructure. 

With this, an affection of atoms would be the making of something like a dog. A collection of atoms called a “dog” can only be called so after we understand that the dog is a product of the atoms coming together. A dog can only exist if the atoms (or substructure of reality) exists first. The dog is dependent on atoms existing.

  

So taking this together, something called substance needs to exist before a dog does. 

Spinoza calls the dog a “mode” of substance.

Prop II Two substances having different attributes have nothing in common 

  

Another common example of a type of substance sometimes argued for is the “mind” or “soul.” This is typically some immaterial and imperceptible property of the universe. 

This is famously argued by Descartes when he posited that a mind / body substance dualism exists; he claims that there are fundamentally two different kinds of things: Things made of atoms, and things made of mind. Because these two kinds of things have different causes (all matter in the universe caused by itself, all mind in the universe is cause by itself) they can't have anything in common. They are two entirely different kinds of things.

  

Taking this together, this translated means that “the conception of matter does not involve the conception of mind; they are causally independent” (as they are both substances)
