Hey Ryan.
It feels weird to talk to you, to really confront you, now. Its only been 3 years, but I feel like I have so much to tell you. So much that I wish someone had told you.
Right now, if I recall correctly, you are getting into philosophy, spending some time on the bass, and spending a lot of time on discord with the usual group: Al, Lucas, Sam, Ryan, Josie, Mak, etc. You also alienated yourself from Ethan, Eli, Caden, Ben, that sorta group for some reason. COVID is still rampant at that point, meaning you are all alone with nobody really there for you. 
I mean, mom, dad, and jake are always there, but you have a lot of trouble talking to them. 

The reason Im writing this letter is because I resent you. You are incredibly annoying to those around you and your belligerence is antisocial. You think you have everything about life figured out, and you really want everyone to know.
