"The boys throw stones at frogs in sport, yet the frogs do not die in sport but in earnest."

"A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects."

"I think we ought to read only the kind of books that wound or stab us. If the book we're reading doesn't wake us up with a blow to the head, what are we reading for? So that it will make us happy, as you write? Good Lord, we would be happy precisely if we had no books, and the kind of books that make us happy are the kind we could write ourselves if we had to. But we need books that affect us like a disaster, that grieve us deeply, like the death of someone we loved more than ourselves, like being banished into forests far from everyone, like a suicide. A book must be the axe for the frozen sea within us. That is my belief.‚Äù - Franz [[Kafka]]

"The poetical character... lives in gusto, be it fair or foul, high or low, rich or poor, mean or elevated... What shocks the virtuous philosopher delights the chameleon poet"

Bill dropped his keys on the counter and stood there staring at them suddenly thinking about all the times hed thrown them there before, and how many days of his life hed wasted repeating the same tasks and rituals in his apartment over and over again. Then he wondered if, realistically, this *was* his life and the unusual part was his time spent other things.

"All great men have qritten proudly, nor cared to explain. They knew that the intellgient reader would come at last, and would thank them"
