# Philosophy-Notes
**Running since July 26, 2022**

This is a constantly-publishing datafile of every note I have taken in philosophy for the past few years. I'm still filling out a lot of the details, formatting, and actual information, so check back frequently if a certain subject hasn't been filled out yet. These notes can be viewed in either Obsidian, Notion or just plain text editors as .md's

Please feel free to take any information and make it your own! Knowledge should be free and open to everybody.

## What Is My Goal?

## Disclaimers

### Disclaimer 1
If an argument exists in this data base, that does not mean I endorse it. If a belief does not exist in this data base, that does not mean I do not endorse it. I do my best to account for all sides of an argument and to try to accurately portray what a certain system believes. I will write down all arguments as honestly as possible, and attempt to engage with them as honestly as possible.

### Disclaimer 2
If there are A2s to certain arguments that I believe to be true, that doesnt mean that I dont endorse the conclusion.
If the following argument were presented, I would still write an A2.
~~~
1. My good friend John told me the Earth is round
2. John is fairly unreliable
3. Therefore the Earth is round
~~~
Even if it were the case that I took the conclusion to be true, I will still note and take seriously counterarguments to the argument presented.

In short, bad arguments can support correct conclusions.
# Formatting

## Terms
* A2: Answer To
* A2A2: Answer To the previous Answer To
* A2A2A2: Answer To the previous Answer To's response

## Best Practice

* Authors get their own notes iff they either write a book or write 3 papers. 
* Books are referred to by their title and get their own notes. When referenced in other notes, they are formatted as (Title, Page Number)
* Papers are referred to in the format of (Author, Year) but do not get their own note. 
	* Books are defined by being larger than 50 pages, papers are defined by being less.

## What Are Tags?

#Cite - Citation needed
#WIP - Something that needs an (at most) 20 minute fix
#Update - Large projects that I learned recently that need a note
#Questions - Tangential questions that arise that I don't yet have an answer to.
#MyArgument - An argument that I came up with myself. If something with this tag mirrors an already existing argument or idea, it is purely by coincidence.
#Quote - Cool quotes that could come in handy. This does not apply to all quotes as some are incredibly narrow.
#MyStance - Currently I am trying to write down my positive position among all of the arguments I find
#blog - Blog posts I write that can be found on my webstite ([ryanbaylon.neocities.org](ryanbaylon.neocities.org))
