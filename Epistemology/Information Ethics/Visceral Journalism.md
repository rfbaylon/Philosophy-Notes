Considerations:
- [ ] Does the family of the victims want it to be shown?
- [ ] Link to [[(Un)civil Disobedience]]; Is this a long-standing issue that is getting nowhere? Is this how we escalate the issue?
- [ ] Is the image well shot (does it even need to be an image?)
- [ ] Is it something the reader can take action about?

Oddly, I feel very differently about political violence and run of the mill violence (ie, Its ok to show the gore of a domestic abuse shelter to make a point about how widespread it is, but just a one off case would feel useless)

Sometimes the question arises as to [whether news organizations should have different standards](http://ethicaljournalismnetwork.org/en/contents/graphic-content-and-the-moral-gap-in-western-journalism) for gory and sensational material depending on where it originates. For instance, a newspaper might not want to show an identifiable photo of a dead child in its community but would run a similar photo of a dead child in from a distant conflict.

# Little-As-Possible

### Sensationalization
It would be wrong to sensationalize gore in order to sell more ads. It would be perverse to have this strong monetary incentive to show sensitive photos and vivid descriptions.
	A2: On its face, its not clear that gore is advertiser friendly.

### In Poor Taste
A2: John Gaps III, photography director of The Des Moines Register, agreed to a point. ''Any time you start applying the word 'taste' to war, you minimize and trivialize what is happening on the battlefield,'' said Mr. Gaps, a former Associated Press combat photographer. ([NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/07/business/nation-war-bringing-combat-home-telling-war-s-deadly-story-just-enough-distance.html))

### Desensitization
''I don't think that editors should feel an obligation to print every bloody picture that comes in,'' he said. ''After a while, people get inured to the suffering in the photograph and that is not good for anyone. In that sense, each successive image has less impact than the one that came before it.'' ([NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/07/business/nation-war-bringing-combat-home-telling-war-s-deadly-story-just-enough-distance.html))

### Unnecessary
Readers can know how bad a bombing is without seeing vivid pictures. 

### Think of the Children!
Children shouldnt be exposed to violence or nudity
	A2: Maybe they should

# Reflect Reality

### Sanitization
There is a strong danger in santizing/censoring the reality of what happened. People cannot react to tragedy with the vigor they ought to without the force of viceral description. Its disturbing, and thats the point. 

### Its Effective
