Considerations:
- [ ] Does the family of the victims want it to be shown?
- [ ] Link to [[Uncivil Disobedience]]; Is this a long-standing issue that is getting nowhere? Is this how we escalate the issue?
- [ ] Is the image well shot (does it even need to be an image?)
- [ ] Is it something the reader can take action about?

Good cases - Bad cases
- Factory farm videos
- Emmet Till
- Sandy Hook mother
- Cigarette Advertising
- Vietnam War

Oddly, I feel very differently about political violence and run of the mill violence (ie, Its ok to show the gore of a domestic abuse shelter to make a point about how widespread it is, but just a one off case would feel useless)

### Sensationalization
It would be wrong to sensationalize gore in order to sell more ads. It would be perverse to have this strong monetary incentive to show sensitive photos and vivid descriptions.
