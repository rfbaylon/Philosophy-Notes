# Intro
In High School, I did Speech and Debate. I was expected to go to our weekly current events meeting to catch up on global news and, on top of that, spend a few extra hours on my own furthering my knowledge. It was drilled in me then that it was good, if not morally necessary, to keep up with the news as much as possible. 

In my experience, this pressure isn't unique to Speech and Debate. Part of participation in liberal society is being an 'informed voter' -- someone who knows enough about the policies of the candidtae they vote for to make a reasoned decision. After all, these decisions will benefit and harm the people around them. In fact, its often argued that informed voting is the backbone to democracy itself, making education one of the highest policy priorities for a well running society. Therefore, keeping up with news, economics, and politics is essential to complete ones civic duties towards the fellow global citizens their policies impact. 

Here, I am going to argue that this ideal is vastly overstated. I will argue that the position that one is ethically obliged to keep up with current events is fairly untenable. I will then argue an even stronger position that, at least for most of the people that will be reading this piece, consuming the news is more harmful than beneficial.
