# Intro
In High School, I did Speech and Debate. I was expected to go to our weekly current events meeting to catch up on global news and, on top of that, spend a few extra hours on my own furthering my knowledge. It was drilled in me then that it was good, if not morally necessary, to keep up with the news as much as possible. 

In my experience, this pressure isn't unique to Speech and Debate. Part of participation in liberal society is being an 'informed voter' -- someone who knows enough about the policies of the candidtae they vote for to make a reasoned decision. After all, these decisions will benefit and harm the people around them. In fact, its often argued that informed voting is the backbone to democracy itself, making education.
