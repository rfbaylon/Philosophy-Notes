# Intro
In High School, I did Speech and Debate. I was expected to go to our weekly current events meeting to catch up on global news and, on top of that, spend a few extra hours on my own furthering my knowledge. It was drilled in me then that it was good, if not morally necessary, to keep up with the news as much as possible. 

In my experience, this pressure isn't unique to Speech and Debate. Part of participation in liberal society is being an 'informed voter' -- someone who knows enough about the policies of the candidate they vote for to make a reasoned decision. After all, these decisions will benefit and harm the people around them. In fact, its often argued that informed voting is the backbone to democracy itself, making education one of the highest policy priorities for a well running society. Therefore, keeping up with news, economics, and politics is essential to complete ones civic duties towards the fellow global citizens their policies impact. 

Here, I am going to argue that this ideal is vastly overstated. I will argue that the position that one is ethically obliged to keep up with current events is fairly untenable. I will then argue an even stronger position that, at least for most of the people that will be reading this piece, consuming the news is more harmful than beneficial. 

News is a broad word. For my purposes here, I want to talk only about the kind of news that crowds the headlines of the New York Times or the Washington Post. Mostly, these are state, national, and global news. Think articles relating to political turmoil in Syria, Nancy Pelosi, Trump indictments, and whatever new anti-trans bill Texas just proposed. Later, I will explicitly sidebar two kinds of news I think are important. My reasons for carving these kinds of news out will be revealed, but I believe these reasons generate a general principle of good information consumption. 
# Epistemic Obligation

In this section, I only aim to argue against the idea that there is an ethical obligation to consume news, even if one has the time and resources to do so. 


# Good Information Consumption

The first is local news. 

The second is specialty news; news related to the interests and passions of the reader. It would be prudent for people interested in computer parts to know when new processers are released, people interested in movies to know when their favorite director is going to release a new movie. Insofar as these projects are important, relevant news should probably be consumed. Obviously, with this kind of news there is no obligation to consume it, but I would not go as far as to argue that this news is harmful.
