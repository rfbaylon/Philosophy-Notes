### Good NDAs (Maybe?)

1) *Informed Consent*  
   1) Clear, explicit language defining what is or is not allowed under NDA  
   2) Defined guidelines for duration of NDA and who NDA affects  
   3) Removal of exploitation and reduction of power imbalance to remove harm of ignorance of signee  
   4) Toe example

Informed consent is not enough because even though *in principle* informed consent would be enough, due to the history of NDAs, completely free agreements are incredibly rare *in practice*. This is why we add the extra condition of relevant business practice.

2) *Relevance to Business Practices*  
   1) **Relevance** depends in part on normal industry functioning and needs to be benefitted without harming employees or consumers  
   2) Ex. business practices/trade secrets, not personal info about any one employee  
   3) Lobbying groups (Dolden) already advocate for this exact limitation to be adopted to applying NDAs  
   4) Why business information only? Because NDAs are an ineffective and non-essential tool for interpersonal conflict. Moreover, allowing NDAs for social matters might allow for NDAs about sexual harassment as outlined in the case to be permissible. Weighing them as an ineffective tool against the risk of letting through NDAs about SH, we should just limit them entirely in the social sphere

Given this, Tiger Woods should *not* have been allowed to issue an NDA with Erica Herman as it for sure failed the second consideration. We do not know whether it failed the first (we weren't there)
