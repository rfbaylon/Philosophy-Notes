## Empirical Skepticism
See [[Sextus Empiricus]]

'Before the founder of the school to which you adhere was born, the argument of the school,
which is no doubt sound, was not yet apparent, although it was really there in nature. In the same way, it is possible that the argument opposing the one you have just propounded is really there in nature but is not yet apparent to us; so we should not yet assent to what is now thought to be a powerful argument'.
	Outlines of Skepticism, 1.xiii.34


"The causal principle of skepticism is the hope of becoming tranquil"
	Outlines of Skepticism, 1.vi.12
"But those who make no determination about what is good and bad by nature neither avoid nor pursue anything with intensity; and hence they are tranquil."
	Outlines of Skepticism, 1.xii.27

There are 4 things taht guide skeptic action:
1. Guidance by nature (percieving and thinking)
2. Necessitation by feelings (hunger and thirst drive us to food and water)
3. Handing down of laws and customs (peity is good and impiety is bad)
4. Teaching of expertises (crafts)	
	Outlines of Skepticism, 1.xi.23-24

### Ok, but Skepticism is a belief system

A2: But the main point is this: in uttering these phrases they say what is apparent to themselves and report their own feelings without holding opinions, affirming nothing about external objects.
	Outlines of Skepticism, 1.vii.14
## Cartesian Skepticism
See [[Descartes]]

[[My Stance]] on epistemic skepticism: We have to buy the argument that we cant know *for sure* whether or not we are being deceived by an evil demon. It is true. We have to take a leap of faith to accept that our sense data are somewhat reliable though in order to operate in the world. 

[[Descartes]]' argument for skepticism

1.  While we dream, we perceive dream objects.
2.  Sense data from dreams are not real.
3.  We can falsely believe sense data from dream objects to be real.
4.  There is nothing that meaningfully and rationally differentiates dream sense data from real sense data.
5.  We can falsely believe sense data from real objects to be false.
6.  Therefore, sense data is doubtable.

	A2:  if we learn logic empirically, and we cannot fully trust empirical knowledge (as per (5)), then we cannot trust logic itself, and thus we cannot trust the above proof. In essence, the proof is self defeating under an empiricist framework ([[Rationalism, Empiricism, & Idealism]]).
		A2A2: You rely on logic to build this argument.
