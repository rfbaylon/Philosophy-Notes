[[De Beauvoir]]: "I believe what we should be doing is questioning the meaning of people's existence"
[[Weil]]: "I can tell you have never gone hungry"

"What the live creature retains from the past and what it expects from the future operate as directions in the present. The dog is never pedantic nor academic; for these things arise only when the past is severed in consciousness from the present and is set up as a model to copy or a storehouse upon which to draw"

"[Ideas] are phases, emotionally and practically distinguished, of a developing underlying quality; they are its moving variations, not separate and independent like [[Locke]]'s and [[Hume]]'s so called ideas and impressions, but are subtle shadings of a pervading and developing hue... In fact, in an experience of thinking, premises emerge only as a conclusion becomes manifest... Like the ocean in the storm, there are a series of waves; suggestions reaching out and being broken in a clash, or being carried onwards by a cooperative wave. A 'conclusion' is no separate and independent thing; it is the consummation of a movement"

"A definition is good when it is sagacious, and it is that when it so points the direction in which we  can move expeditiously toward having an experience."

"'What would be better for us to believe'! This sounds very like a defintion of truth. it comes very near saying what we *ought* to believe: and in *that* definition none of you would find any oddity. Ought we ever not to believe what it is *better for us* to believe? And can we then keep the notion of what is better for us, and what is true for us, permanently apart?"

## Tender and Tough Minds
[[James]] makes a distinction in philosophy between two minds:
Tender: rationalistic, intellectual, idealistic, optimistic, religious, free-willist, monistic
Tough: empiricist, sensationalistic, materialistic, pessimistic, irreligious, fatalistic, pluralistic, skeptical
	In my mind, it makes sense to group [[Leibniz]] as tender and [[Locke]] as tough.
James promises that pragmatism can marry the tender and tough. To have the rigor of the and brutality of the tough mind, but the romanticism and lifestyle of the tender.

## The Pragmatic Method
While watching some of his friends argue about a man chasing a squirrel around a tree (the metaphysical question being "Does the man go around the squirrel?"), James steps in and gives a definite answer: "Which party is right depends on what you *practically mean* by 'going round' the squirrel. If you mean passing from the north of him to the east, then to the south, then to the west, and then to the north of him again, obviously the man does go round him, for he occupies these successive positions." But if on the contrary you mean first being in front of him, then on the right of him, then behind him, then on his left, and finally in front again, it is quite as obvious that the man fails to go round him,  for by the compensating movements the squirrel makes, he keeps his belly turned toward the man all the time, and his back turned away. Make the distinction and there is no occasion for further dispute. You are both right and both wrong according as you conceive the verb 'to go round' in one practical fashion or the other."

# Blending of Reason and Emotion

William [[James]] compared the course of a conscious experience to the alternate flights and perchings of a bird
	[[Art as Experience]], 58

"When we perceive by means of the eyes as causal aids, the liquidity of water, the coldness of ice, the solidity of rocks, the bareness of trees in winter, its is certain that other qualities than those of the eye are conspicuous and controlling in perception"
	[[Art as Experience]], 128

"Did anyone who read (a) poem esthetically make --at the same time -- a conscious distinction of sense and thought, of matter and form? If so, they did not read or hear esthetically, for the esthetic value of the stanzas lies in the integration of the two."
	[[Art as Experience]], 137

Perceptions do not remain in the mind, as would be suggested by the trite simile of the seal and wax (from [[Descartes]]), passive and changeless until time wears off their rough edges and makes them fade. No, perceptions fall into the brain rather as seeds into a furrowed field or even as sparks into a keg of gunpowder."
	Santayana, cited in [[Art as Experience]], 163
